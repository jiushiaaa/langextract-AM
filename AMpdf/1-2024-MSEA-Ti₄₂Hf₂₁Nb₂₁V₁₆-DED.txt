ABSTRACT
While refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising potential for extreme applications, those directly
fabricated via additive manufacturing methods have been hindered by their inferior mechanical properties,
particularly at high temperatures. In this study, we successfully produced a Hf-Nb-Ti-V RHEA using directed
energy deposition (DED) technique, achieving satisfactory tensile properties across a wide temperature range.
This was accomplished by inducing severe lattice distortions in the fabricated RHEA, which can be traced back to
the local chemical fluctuations present in the newly fabricated RHEA and the significant atomic radius mismatch.
Due to strong solute pinning, these factors contribute to the superior yield strength of the DED-fabricated RHEA
across a wide temperature range. Furthermore, the elastic constants in the fabricated RHEA show a negligible
temperature dependence, revealed by first-principles calculations, ensuring satisfactory strengths even at high
temperatures. This alloy design strategy, which involves introducing significant lattice distortion and main￾taining the temperature-low sensitivity of the elastic moduli, opens up new possibilities for directly fabricating
RHEAs with superior high-temperature properties.
1. Introduction
Unlike the traditional alloying design concept, which involves one
principal metallic element doped with minor alloying elements, the
high-entropy alloy (HEA) design paradigm does not rely on a unique
base metal [1,2]. This approach allows for creating HEAs or
multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) with remarkable mechanical [3,
4] and superior electrochemical properties [5]. HEAs composed of re￾fractory elements demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties under
elevated temperatures [6], far surpassing Ni-based superalloys [7,8].
This not only presents opportunities for advanced applications, from
aerospace to nuclear reactors [7,9] but also broadens the compositional
space for advanced alloy design [10]. For advanced structural materials
applications, refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) typically exhibit
satisfactory mechanical properties at both room temperature (RT) and
high temperatures [6,11]. A representative of the former is HfNbTiZrTa
RHEA [12], and the latter is MoNbTaW RHEA [8]. However, these al￾loys, despite their impressive properties at their respective application
temperatures, are seen to perform poorly at unaccommodated temper￾atures [8,12]. For instance, HfNbTiZrTa RHEA exhibits significantly
deteriorated tensile properties when the applied temperature exceeds a
certain threshold [12,13], and MoNbTaW RHEA rarely shows tensile
ductility, especially at room temperature [14]. This necessitates the
development of novel RHEAs that can meet the wide temperature range
requirements.
To meet the potential engineering applications of RHEAs, selection
of fabrication processes is crucial. Generally, casting [3,4] and powder
metallurgy (PM) [15] methods are the primary techniques used for

manufacturing RHEAs, but they have inherent drawbacks. For instance,
as-cast RHEAs undergo homogenization-rolling-annealing procedures
[3,4], significantly lengthening the manufacturing period. Although PM
methods offer the potential to directly fabricate RHEAs with complex
geometries [16], these processes often introduce impurities or lead to
severe matrix decomposition [15] even if the designed RHEA has a
single body cubic crystal (BCC) structure. Laser-aided directed energy
deposition (DED) technologies, known for their high degree of freedom
and precision, enable the customization of products with complex ge￾ometries while saving raw materials and time [17,18]. However, suc￾cessfully fabricating RHEAs with superior mechanical properties has
been challenging over the past decade [19–26]. Numerous attempts
have been made to fabricate RHEAs via AM methods but often resulted
in a variety of defects and thus poor RT mechanical performance
[19–26] much less the tensile properties at elevated temperatures.
Recently, several efforts were proposed like phase engineering [20], the
solid solution treatment [27] as well as laser energy regulation [28] to
enhance RT tensile properties of DED-fabircated RHEAs by controlling
the formation of harmful phases. Additionally, selecting alloys with an
inherent ductile nature can also facilitate the fabrication of RHEAs with
enhanced tensile strength and ductility compared to their as-cast
counterparts [10]. However, it is clear that there is still data blank in
tensile properties across a wide temperature range of AM-fabricated
RHEAs.
Among the well-known core effects in HEAs, lattice distortion is
often credited for impressive properties such as the Elinvar effect [29],
high strength at elevated temperatures [7], and strength-ductility syn￾ergy in RHEAs [3,30,31]. Whether it’s the presence of oxygen in
HfNbTiZr RHEA [32] or the local chemical order in Ti-based MPEA [3]
that resolves the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma, or even the
long-range chemical fluctuations [4], the influence of local lattice
distortion (LLD) on the mechanical properties of BCC type alloys is
significant. Customizing LLD in RHEAs is crucial for enabling remark￾able properties, particularly superior high-temperature strength. RHEAs
containing Zr and Hf have been shown to cause a significant atomic
radius mismatch [9,33], resulting in a larger LLD in these alloys
compared to face-centered cubic (FCC) type HEAs [34]. Additionally,
introducing elements with low temperature-dependent elastic constants,
such as Nb and V [7], can enable a stable yield strength to overcome heat
softening under elevated temperatures [8,35]. Alloying methods, such
as the addition of Ti, are effective in improving the ductility of brittle
RHEAs [36]. Designing LLD in RHEAs to achieve exceptional strength
under elevated temperatures while maintaining ductility is significant in
additive manufacturing of RHEAs. Despite the study of the relationship
between lattice distortion and friction stress in Nb-contained high--
entropy alloys [37], it is crucial to fully understand the mechanisms for
the superior mechanical properties induced by LLD at elevated
temperatures.
In this study, we successfully fabricated a Ti42Hf21Nb21V16 (referred
to as T42) RHEA using a laser-engineered net shaping (LENS) approach,
also known as a laser-aided DED technology, via incorporating an
extremely high energy input for remelting. This alloy exhibits superior
tensile properties at room temperature and even at elevated tempera￾tures. Furthermore, we examined the local chemical complexity in the
AM-fabricated RHEAs and quantitatively investigated the LLD using pair
distribution function analysis of the x-ray total scattering data. We also
employed simulation methods, including first-principles calculations
and crystal plasticity finite element modeling, to study the basic physical
parameters and mechanical response under varying temperatures. Our
findings pave the way for the direct manufacturing of RHEAs with su￾perior mechanical properties and provide insights into the mechanical
responses of these RHEAs under extreme conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Sample preparation
The T42 RHEA sample was additively manufactured using a mixture
of pure Ti, Hf, Nb, and V powders (all with purities exceeding 99.95 %),
as shown in Fig. 1 a, with a nearly even distribution, illustrated by the
corresponding elemental maps (Fig. 1 b). The particle size of the powder
mixture was determined via a particle analyzer (Malvern Mastersizer
3000), giving an average particle size of ~81 μm (Fig. 1 c), indicating
the acceptable flowability of the powder mixture used for LENS. In
addition, we also applied x-ray diffraction (XRD, λ = 1.54 Å for Cu Kα)
testing, given in Fig. 1 d, showing the phase structure of well-mixed
elemental powders, which were prepared using plasma rotation elec￾trode atomization technology. During the LENS process, a remelting
procedure (detailed in Ref. [10]) involving ultra-high energy input was
performed to maintain a uniform elemental distribution and prevent the
presence of un-melted elemental powder, which could occur due to the
significant differences in melting points among these elemental pow￾ders. Argon was introduced into the LENS machine’s (Optomec LENS
MR-7) working chamber to maintain a low oxygen content (below 200
ppm). The fabrication process involved a scanning speed of 5 mm/s,
hatching space of 381 μm, working laser power of 550 W, remelting
power of 800 W, and a layer thickness of 200 μm. After the LENS pro￾cedure, a bulk RHEA sample measuring 70 × 12 × 5 mm was obtained
for further testing, as displayed in Fig. 1 e.
2.2. Mechanical tests
The tensile tests were conducted on the as-deposited samples at
various temperatures, including RT, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K, and 1073 K, at
a strain rate of 1 × 10− 3 s
− 1
. The tests were carried out using a Zwick￾Roell Proline universal testing machine equipped with a heating
chamber, and strain evaluation was performed using digital image
correlation (DIC). The tensile bar used in the experiments had a gauge
length of 6 mm and a thickness of 1 mm. Prior to the hot tensile
experiment, the tensile bar was preloaded at 30 N to compensate for
thermal expansion during the heating process. A heating speed of 10 K/s
was employed to reach the target temperature, and the hot tensile test
commenced after a 10-min thermal insulation period at the target
temperatures in the heating chamber.
2.3. Microstructural and structural characterization
We utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Verios 5 UC,
Thermo Fisher) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD, C-swift,
Oxford) to analyze the microstructure of LENS-fabricated RHEA. The
SEM specimens, including the deformed samples, were ground with
2000-grit SiC paper, polished with 1 μm micro-sized polycrystalline
diamond solutions (Struers), and then finished with a finer polishing
using a 50 nm sized SiO2 particle solution (OPS, Struers). Subsequently,
the samples underwent ion polishing by an Ion Beam Etching machine
(EM TIC 3X, Leica) at 5 kV for 1 h. Additionally, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, Talos F200X, Thermo Fisher) was employed to
investigate the microstructure at the nano-scale, with samples prepared
via focus-ion beam (FIB, Helios 5 UX). The atomic structure of the as￾deposited RHEA was characterized using an aberration-corrected TEM
(Spectra 300, Thermo Fisher) at a working voltage of 300 kV, while
deformed samples were observed in Talos F200X to study dislocation
evolution after tensile tests at different temperatures. The atomic
chemical composition was analyzed using 3D atom probe tomography
(APT, LEAP 6000 XR), with needle-shaped specimens sampled by FIB
(Helios 5 UX) using the milling and lift-out method. The needle-shaped
APT sample was examined in voltage mode (detection efficiency 0.5 %)
at a temperature of 50 K with a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz and 20
%, respectively. The collected data was then used to reconstruct the 3D

elemental distribution using IVAS software. The phase composition of
the as-deposited RHEA was investigated via x-ray diffraction (XRD) and
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in TEM equipped with energy￾dispersive X-ray (EDX). Additionally, atomic pair distribution function
(PDF) analysis was conducted using the X-ray total scattering data
collected on a laboratory X-ray scattering instrument (SmartLab,
Rigaku) equipped with a rotating anode silver target (λ = 0.56 Å for Ag
Kα), and then extracted from the program of PDFgetX3 [38]. During the
data collection procedure, the transmission setup utilized a capillary
sealed with the sample and subtracted the data from the empty capillary
to obtain the scattering signal of the detected sample. The acquired data
were processed using Fourier transform on the normalized X-ray scat￾tering function (F(Q)), Q = 4π • sin θ/λ, to obtain the respective PDF (G
(R)). After obtaining the required PDF, the PDFgui package [39] was
used to fit different structure models of the as-fabricated RHEA.
2.4. High temperature oxidation experiments
For investigating the failure mechanism of the as-fabricated T42
RHEA, we carried out 1073 K oxidation experiments. The oxidized
samples were cut into dimensions of 10 × 10 × 4 mm via an electrical
discharge cutting machine and then underwent grinding as well as
polishing procedures. The samples were oxidized in an open-air tube
furnace. The weights of the oxidized samples processing at 1h, 3h, 6h,
12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h as well 120h were collected by a precise balance
(Sartorius SQP), and the corresponding microstructure and phase
composition were achieved via SEM (Verios 5 UC) and XRD (Smartlab,
Cu λ = 1.54 Å) experiments.
2.5. First-principles calculations
To determine the temperature dependence on the physical moduli in
the target alloy system, we utilized the Cambridge Sequential Total
Energy Package (CASTEP) [40] to conduct first-principles calculations
using the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) method, which has been
demonstrated to be effective in studying the fundamental physical
properties of HEAs [41]. Within the CASTEP package, the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was
employed for geometric structure optimization, utilizing TPSD algo￾rithms. The OTFG norm serving pseudopotential was employed without
selecting spin polarization. We customized the energy cutoff to 1200 eV
and utilized k-points of 20 × 20 × 20 implemented on the conventional
cell, setting the maximum total energy loss to 1 × 10− 5 eV⋅atom− 1
.
Other relevant settings included ensuring the maximum forces on single
atoms were less than 0.03 eV⋅Å− 1
, atom placement was less than 0.001
eV⋅Å− 1
, and the total stress tensor order was chosen as 0.05 GPa.

attempts often encountered issues with unmelted elemental powders
[19,22,23], which significantly affected the properties of the manufac￾tured RHEAs. In this study, we applied a remelting procedure to fabri￾cate the T42 RHEA, and the microstructure of which is shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2 a and b display the EBSD results collected from the upper (XY) and
lateral (XZ) planes, respectively. These different planes reveal distinct
grain morphologies; the XY plane shows equiaxed grains with a mean
size of 200 μm, while the lateral plane exhibits a columnar crystal
morphology with nearly double the mean size (Fig. 2 a (i) and b (i)). The
microscale strain, reflected in the Kernel Average Misorientation map
(Fig. 2 a (ii) and b (ii)), shows no significant differences in microstrain
distribution across different fabrication directions in the selected RHEA
after the AM procedure. Notably, a single BCC phase structure was
formed after the AM procedure (Fig. 2 a (iii) and b (iii)), which is sup￾ported by the non-equilibrium phase diagram (see Supplementary In￾formation (SI), Fig S1) obtained via the CALPHAD method. To ensure
evenly distributed alloying elements, we simultaneously acquired EDS
elemental maps (Fig. 2 c), which eliminated the formation of unmelted
elemental powder when applying the remelting procedure during the
fabrication of the selected RHEA. After post-processing the IPF figure
collated from the XY surface, we obtained the corresponding pole and
inverse pole figure density maps (Fig. 2d and e), indicating the forma￾tion of a <001>//(110) texture after additive manufacturing [10].
We then examined the nano-structure of the as-fabricated T42 RHEA,
with the results presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 a (i), contrast differences are
observed in the as-fabricated T42 RHEA. However, the corresponding
EDS mappings (Fig. 3 a (ii)) indicate that there are no significant dif￾ferences between the composed constituents. Subsequently, under
HRTEM, the contrast difference is still evident, as displayed in Fig. 3 b
(i). By amplifying the corresponding area, we obtained the atomic map,
shown in Fig. 3 b (ii), indicating the differences in the formation of
lattice structure in the as-fabricated T42 alloy. We then utilized the
Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA) method [42] to study the lattice-scale
lattice strain based on the atomic scale map (Fig. 3 c (i)), as depicted
in Fig. 3 c (ii), revealing the presence of significant lattice strain induced
by lattice distortion [43,44]. Based on the FFT result (Fig. 3 c (ii))
through Fig. 3 c (i), we collected the atomic scale map from the [001]
axis of the as-fabricated T42 alloy. The formation of lattice distortion
originates from atomic radius and shear modulus mismatches [45],
which are also promoted by local chemical fluctuations, as given in Fig S
2 (SI). Consequently, we conducted an APT experiment, with the results
presented in Fig. 3 d. The APT map (Fig. 3 d (i)), which excerpted the 20
at. % V isocomposition, supports the formation of nano-scale composi￾tion heterogeneity. Additionally, by collecting the corresponding
compositional proximity histogram of the selected particle in Fig. 3 d (i),
the presence of LCFs in the as-fabricated T42 alloy is evident. It is
important to note that, due to the sampling size for the APT experiment,
the acquired elemental concentrations differ from the microcosmic EDS
results, indicating the presence of compositional heterogeneity.
The EBSD phase map (Fig. 2 a(iii)) confirms the formation of a single
BCC phase in the as-fabricated T42 alloy. Additionally, we conducted an
XRD experiment to investigate its phase structure, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
The XRD profile (Fig. 4 a) supports the formation of a single BCC phase
in the as-fabricated RHEA. As previously mentioned, local lattice strain
is produced in the as-fabricated T42 RHEA. To demonstrate the presence
of local lattice strain/distortion, the atomic PDF, acquired via Fourier
transformation from the total scattering data, is presented in Fig. 4 (b),
providing inter-atomic distances in real space [46]. Our PDF curve ex￾hibits a similar characteristic to the Hf-contained BCC HEA [9], indi￾cating the accuracy of the total scattering data collected using the Ag
target (λ = 0.559 Å). By fitting the PDF data, we obtained a fitting curve
in Fig. 4 b (red line), which yields a lattice constant of 3.32626 Å.
However, an overlap of the first and second atomic shell was also
observed in our Hf-containing RHEA, as shown in Fig. 4 b (i), indicating
a strong local lattice distortion (LLD) caused by the severe motion
among neighboring atoms [47]. We fitted different r regions separately
to reveal the LLD, which are [48]: 1) local range (one unit cell <4 Å); 2)
long-range (3 unit cell) as well as 3) intermediate range, as shown in
Fig. 4 b (i-ii). As the LLD can be reflected as the shift of the PDF peak [9],
the local strain can be obtained via [9,48]:
ε =
⃒
⃒afit − aave
⃒
⃒
aave
Eq. 1
where afit is the fitting lattice constant in different r regions while aave
denotes the average lattice constant in the whole r range. Consequently,
we obtained the LLD in different regions, as shown in Fig. 4 c, indicating
a local range lattice strain of 3.68 %, much higher than that in the FCC
HEAs [49] but also slightly larger than the values in Hf-/Zr- containing
RHEA [9].
3.2. Mechanical properties under elevated temperatures
To obtain the mechanical responses of the as-fabricated T42 alloy,
we conducted tensile tests at different temperatures, which would be
more valuable than compressive tests for evaluating its engineering
applicational potential [20], with the results presented in Fig. 5 (a). The
AM-fabricated T42 alloy exhibited superior strength and ductility syn￾ergy, with a yield strength of approximately 1030 MPa and a fracture
strain of 22.5 %, surpassing the reported AM-fabricated RHEA [10].
When the tensile temperature was increased to 673 K, the yield strength
of the as-fabricated T42 alloy decreased to ~681 MPa, while the fracture
strain increased to 27.8 % in our study. According to the Consid`ere
criteria [50], strain hardening was observed during the
high-temperature tensile test. Upon further increasing the temperature
to 773 K, a decrease in the yield strength to ~661 MPa was observed in
the as-fabricated T42 alloy. Additionally, the fracture strain decreased to
~16.8 % compared to the tensile curve obtained at 673 K. Following the
tensile test at 873 K, a slight decrease (approximately 25 MPa) in the
yield strength and a significant decrease in the fracture strain (~7.5 %)
were observed compared to the curves obtained at lower temperatures.
It should be mentioned that the as-fabricated T42 alloy was completely
disabled at that temperature when the tensile temperature was raised to
1073 K, and valid results could not be obtained. Additionally, we
compared the yield strength versus temperature of the as-fabricated T42
alloy to the as-cast RHEAs [51–55] and the AM-fabricated superalloy
[56–58] and other alloys with reported high temperature tensile prop￾erties [59,60], due to the absence of reported data in the AM-fabricated
RHEAs, as shown in Fig. 5 b. The as-fabricated T42 alloy exhibited su￾perior yield strength at room temperature among those reported alloys.
With increasing working temperature, the tensile yield strength slightly
decreased but remained competitive among the AM-fabricated super￾alloys [56–58], although it was negligibly lower than the as-cast
HfNbTiZrTa alloy [54,55]. The latter is generally included the high
melting point alloying element Ta, enabling a higher melting point [61]
compared to our target alloy. However, under a high-temperature ten￾sile test, especially above 823 K, matrix decomposition would occur
[12], significantly deteriorating both strength and ductility in the
HfNbTiZrTa alloy [13,54,55]. Although there have the Ni-based super￾alloys with even superior mechanical performance at higher tempera￾ture than our alloy fabricated alloy, successful fabrication of superalloys
with superior mechanical properties by AM is still a long way to go
[56–58]. In conclusion, although our as-fabricated T42 alloy has a
relatively lower melting point, it still exhibits superior mechanical
properties at elevated temperatures.
Following the tensile tests, we examined the fractured surfaces and
the external surfaces parallel to the tensile direction using SEM, as
depicted in Fig. 6, which illustrates the fracture morphologies under
different temperatures. After the RT and 673 K tensile tests, complete
ductile fracture surfaces were observed, as shown in Fig. 6 a (i-ii),
characterized by the formation of dimples. When the tensile tempera￾ture was increased to 773 K, surface cracks were observed (Fig. 6 a (iii)),

and most of the fracture surface had dimples, with the presence of
cleavage fracture characteristics under the surface cracks. Upon further
increasing the tensile temperature to 873 K, a few dimples were
observed, but most of the fracture surface exhibited river patterns (Fig. 6
a (iv)), indicating the formation of quasi-cleavage fracture under that
particular temperature and external stress. Regarding the observation of
the external surface, as shown in Fig. 6 b, both the RT and 673 K tension
samples exhibited large plastic regions, composed of highly deformed
grains with shear bands and a high density of dislocations. In contrast, a
small plastic deformed region was observed in the 873 K tension sample,
with surface cracks occurring during the tensile test. As the external
surfaces were prepared by grinding and polishing, surface cracks were
rarely observed in the 773 K tension sample, which can be seen from the
front fracture surface in Fig. 6 a (iii).
3.3. Deformed microstructure under elevated temperature
To further investigate the deformed microstructure near the fracture
cross section of the as-fabricated T42 samples after tension under
elevated temperatures, we conducted EBSD experiments, the results of
which are presented in Fig. 7. In the EBSD IPF figures, we observed
extensive shear bands, rather than the formation of deformed twin
structures [20], formed under the RT tensile test. However, the amount
of shear bands was noticeably reduced in samples tensioned under
elevated temperatures. Additionally, we utilized Kernel Average
Misorientation (KAM) maps to study the degree of deformation or the
distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations [62]. From the KAM
figures, it was evident that highly deformed regions near the grain
boundaries or the shear bands exhibited a high density of dislocations.
As the twinning-induced plasticity effect [10] was eliminated in our

study, we also examined the phase structure of the deformed surfaces,
which indicated that no phase transformation occurred under tensile
deformation, regardless of the temperatures applied in the study.
We then investigated the dislocation evolution during deformation
under different temperature tensile tests using TEM. In Fig. 8 a (i), the
TEM bright field picture of the RT tensile test reveals the presence of
substantial planar slip bands and dislocation walls, while wavy slips
were observed in that region with pinned dislocations after the RT
tensile test (Fig. 8 a (ii)). The corresponding SAED pattern confirms that
no phase transformation occurred after the RT tensile test, and the
collected zone axis was [1 1 1] (Fig. 8 a (ii)). For the 673 K tensioned T42
sample, as shown in Fig. 8 b, we also observed bits of slip bands,
dislocation walls, and pinning effects in the sample tensioned at that
temperature. Additionally, the deformed structure after the 873 K ten￾sile test, as depicted in Fig. 8 c, indicates tangled dislocations, disloca￾tion jog, and dislocation loops, with the pinning effect still present in the

high-temperature deformed nanostructures. Based on the high￾resolution TEM picture (Fig. 8 c (iii)) and its corresponding inverse
fast Fourier transform (iFFT) (Fig. 8 c (iv)), we can assert that the
combined effect of edge and screw dislocations was at work during the
high-temperature deformation process. To verify the presence of dislo￾cation loops and eliminate the formation of oxides after high￾temperature tensile tests, the EDS maps of Fig. 8 c (ii) are shown in
Fig. 8 d, indicating evenly distributed compositions even after high￾temperature tensile tests.
3.4. High temperature oxidation property
Despite the superior mechanical properties exhibited by the as￾fabricated T42 alloy under elevated temperatures, it proved to be not
applicable under a tensile test at 1073 K. Consequently, we conducted a
long-term (120-h) oxidation experiment under atmospheric conditions
at 1073 K. After a 1-h oxidation test, we observed the oxidized surfaces
of the as-fabricated T42 sample, as shown in Fig. 9 a, where surface
cracks were present in the oxidation layer. Subsequently, we collected
the elemental distributions on the oxidation layer, as depicted in Fig. 9
b, indicating the formation of oxides of corresponding constituents in
the T42 alloy. The mass gain of oxidized samples under different pro￾cessing times (1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, as well as 120 h)
are shown in Fig. 9 c, clearly demonstrating a nearly linear increase in
mass gain with an increase in processing time. Additionally, we con￾ducted XRD tests to study the phase evolution of the oxides of the AM￾fabricated T42 alloy (see Fig. 9 d), indicating that prolonging the pro￾cessing time would not affect the oxide species, only the number of
oxides. After 120 h of high-temperature oxidation, we observed the
macroscopic features as well as the microstructure of the as-fabricated
T42 alloy in Fig S 3 a and b (SI), revealing severe dehiscence on the
oxidation layer, while the elemental distribution of the oxidation layer
(Fig S 3 c) showed no significant difference compared to the short-term
oxidized T42 alloy.
3.5. Basic physical properties of selected RHEA at elevated temperatures
In our study, we utilized the EOS approach (for details see Note 2 in
SI) to obtain the thermal dynamic parameters of the selected RHEA (as
shown in Fig S 4 in SI) and then obtained the temperature dependence of
the lattice constant as listed in Table 1. After the calculation, the lattice
constant of the T42 alloy was determined to be 3.3176 Å, which is very
consistent with the fitted PDF result of 3.32626 Å, indicating that an
appropriate parameter setting was applied in this calculation procedure.
Based on the calculated lattice constants, we applied first-principles
calculations to obtain the independent elastic constants, C11, C12, and
C44, which also meet the requirements of the Born-Huang mechanical
stability criterion [63], as expressed in the following equation:
C11-C12>0, C11+C12 > 0, C44 > 0 Eq. 2
Fig. 10 shows the basic physical properties of the T42 alloy at cor￾responding temperatures. The linear increase of the lattice constant was
found as a function of temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 10 a. The
selected RHEA exhibits a degree of anisotropy which is less than 1 (see
Fig. 10 b) among the test temperatures, indicating the loss of anisotropy
at higher temperatures. The independent elastic constants of C11 and
C12 slightly increased with elevated temperatures, while C44 slightly
decreased, resulting in a slight decrease of Young’s moduli and shear
moduli (seen Fig. 10 c and d) in the selected RHEA and a weak tem￾perature dependence on the basic moduli of the selected RHEA. By
applying similar calculations on the pure constituents in Ti-based RHEA,
we showed the temperature-dependent Young’s and shear moduli in
Fig. 10 c and d, which illustrates a weak temperature-dependence on E
and G in those pure metals, similar to the results given in the study by
Feng et al. [7].

temperature, we modelled the tensile properties of the as-fabricated T42
alloy using the DAMASK (Düsseldorf Advanced Materials Simulation
Kit) package [64] and a dislocation-based crystal plasticity constitutive
model (Details in Note 2, SI). We utilized the actual 3D EBSD con￾struction (Fig. 11 a) to create polycrystalline representative volume el￾ements (RVEs) with near-identical experimental morphologies (Fig. 11
b) via the DEREAM3D package [65]. Taking into account the presence of
preferable orientations formed in the as-fabricated T42 alloy (Fig. 2 d),
we assigned near-identical preferable orientations in our RVEs, as shown
in Fig. 11 c. The RVEs used for CPFEM were meshed into 60 × 60 × 60
elements, containing 27 grains, and a tensile rate of 0.001 s
− 1 was
applied in the X-direction during hot-tensile simulations. By fitting the
experimental tensile curves and simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 11 d,
we introduced the average absolute relative error (AARE) and the cor￾relation coefficient (R) to verify the reliability of the CPFE model used in
this study, as follows [66]:

but high R values in our simulations, indicating a strong correlation
between experimental and simulation results. Additionally, we obtained
the temperature dependence on the constitutive parameters, listed in

well-fitted experimental and simulation results indicate the accuracy of
the DFT calculations and show the way for directly predicting the me￾chanical response of novel alloys.
4. Detailed discussion
4.1. Microstructure and origins of lattice distortion in RHEAs
To achieve an evenly distributed macro-scale RHEA, we utilized a
remelting procedure to fabricate the chosen RHEA. In the AM-fabricated
alloys, the highest thermal conductivity coincides with the BD [68],
which can instigate the formation of columnar grains along the BD. This
favors the orientation of the <001> direction [69,70], and the corre￾sponding results are displayed in Fig. 2. Despite the even compositional
distribution in the AM-fabricated T42 RHEA observed in Fig. 3 a (ii),
local chemical fluctuations are present at the atomic level (Fig. 3 d),
even deviating from the nominal composition. The formation of LCFs
has been proven to be an effective barrier for dislocation motion,
thereby enabling the strength-ductility synergy in BCC-type RHEAs
[71]. The formation of LCF can be determined by the negative mixing
enthalpy of the compositional constituents [4] In our study, the V
element has a relatively higher negative mixing enthalpy with other
compositional constituents [4], resulting in atomic segregation in the
as-fabricated T42 alloy, as shown in Fig. 3 d.
We also examined the LLD produced in the AM-fabricated T42 alloy.
Although the XRD method is effective for investigating lattice distortion
by reducing peak intensity [72,73], the peak intensity and width are still
influenced by the crystal microstructure, size, and textures [74,75]. Due
to the presence of LCFs, commonly reported in Hf-containing RHEAs
[71], fractal-like lattice distortion was observed in HRTEM and
confirmed by the FFT patterns of their corresponding selected areas
(Fig. 3 b(ii)) and the atomic strain map obtained via the GPA method
(Fig. 3 c (ii)), commonly used for studying LLD in other HEAs [76,77].
Conversely, PDF converted from the diffraction total scattering data can
provide valuable inter-atomic positions [46]. Tong et al. [9] found that

Zr- and Hf-containing RHEAs have an overlap of the 1st and 2nd atomic
shells, similarly depicted in Fig. 4 b (i), indicating the presence of large
LLD in these alloys. Compared to the increase of chemical complexity in
RHEAs, inducing atomic size mismatch seems to be more effective in
increasing LLD, such as adding Hf or Zr large atomic radius elements [9].
We fitted different regions in our PDF curve (refer to Fig. 4 b), as the PDF
peak position is a function of the lattice constant [9]. Ultimately, a
significantly higher lattice strain/distortion of 3.68 % than that in pre￾vious Hf- and Zr- containing RHEAs was obtained (see Fig. 4 c), resulting
from the solution interstitial atoms [10], which indicates the presence of
large LLD in the as-fabricated T42 HEA.
4.2. The mechanical responses at different temperatures
The lattice distortion in traditional alloys is well-established, typi￾cally involving solute atoms in the matrix, resulting from the atomic size
and elastic modulus mismatch [45,78], which can distort the local
elastic field and hinder dislocation movement [75] to ensure a higher
yield strength. In RHEAs, the solute and solvent atoms show no signif￾icant differences [1], hence the accumulated contribution by lattice
distortion and modulus mismatch to the solid strengthening in RHEAs is
considered [78]. RHEAs composed of high melting point elements
exhibit excellent structural stability and heat softening resistance [8,
79], contributing to their superior high-temperature strength. RHEAs,
typically characterized by significant lattice distortion and modulus
mismatch, demonstrate superior strength [8,79] or super-elasticity [29]
under high temperatures. For instance, in the CrMoNbV RHEA, a giga￾pascal compressive yield strength at 1273 K was formed due to the
substantial modulus mismatch and atomic-size mismatch between Cr
and other constituents [7]. In our study, we discovered that a large
lattice strain was formed in our T42 HEA (refer to Fig. 4) due to
Fig. 9. 1073 K oxidation results. a, The oxidation layer morphology after 1h oxidation test. b, Amplified microstructure as well as the corresponding elemental

significant lattice radius mismatch but less modulus mismatch [10] than
the CrMoNbV alloy [7]. This can enable superior yield strength at RT
(refer to Fig. 5 a) in our LENS-fabricated T42 RHEA. Under elevated
temperatures, strength softening would occur [7] and deteriorative
mechanical properties would result from phase decomposition in
HfNbTiZrTa alloy [12] even though the mentioned RHEA has significant
lattice distortion [9]. We conducted EBSD and TEM experiments on
deformed structures under different temperature conditions, revealing
the presence of a single phase regardless of temperatures rather than the
phase decomposition (Figs. 7 and 8) supported by the calculated phase
diagram in Fig S1 (SI). Additionally, the value of lattice distortion shows
a positive correlation with temperature increase [7], indicating that
larger lattice distortion would be produced under elevated tempera￾tures, enabling the stability of high yield strength in our T42 alloy under
elevated temperatures.
On the other hand, the high-temperature strength can also be influ￾enced by the temperature dependence of the elastic modulus [7], which
determines the zero-temperature yield strength as well as the energy
barrier for the thermal-activated flow [80,81]. In other words, the
insensitive temperature dependence in the elastic constants can main￾tain the yield strength at elevated temperatures [7] and postpone the
formation of softening. Although we did not include the lattice distor￾tion in our first principles calculation (details given in Note 1, SI). The
calculated moduli were used in the CPFEM, demonstrating significant
consistency between the experimental and simulation results (Fig. 11 d).
This validates the proposed methods for studying the
temperature-dependence on the basic physical properties under
elevated temperatures. Although a larger temperature-dependence in
both E and G was observed in CrMoNbV and Inconel 718 alloys [7], the
rule of mixtures on moduli [82] can also be used for calculating the
modulus of materials, especially for Nb and V, with a weak temperature
dependence [7,35], which were proven to maintain the
high-temperature strengths in the reported alloy.
We proceeded to discuss the deformation mechanism in the
deformed T42 alloy. The presence of lattice distortion led to the obser￾vation of wavy-like and pinned dislocations in the deformed alloy under
room temperature (RT), as depicted in Fig. 8. This is due to the inter￾stitial solute atoms creating a heterogeneous stress field [83], which pins
the gliding dislocations and transforms the straight dislocation line into
a wavy configuration [84]. At elevated temperatures, dislocation loops
were also observed in samples deformed at 673 K and 873 K (see Fig. 8 b
and c), facilitated by the strong solute pinning effect caused by the even
larger distorted lattice [85] under these temperatures. Despite
non-screw dislocations being proven effective for improving high tem￾perature hardening in RHEAs [80,81,86], our study observed mixed
characteristics of dislocations in the deformed T42 alloy at 873 K (Fig. 8
c), exhibiting a similar dislocation structure to the hot compressed
CrMoNbV alloy [7].
4.3. The failure mechanism of RHEA under higher temperature
The work-hardening effect present in the 673 K tensioned T42
sample makes it easier to understand that effective work-hardening
delays the formation of necking [87] than in the RT-deformed sample.

When the tensile temperature was increased to 773 K, oxidation of the
base metal occurred [88], inducing surface cracks under external stress
[89], and presenting regional transcrystalline fracture characteristics on
the fracture surface (Fig. 6 a (iii)). Further increasing the tensile tem￾perature resulted in a mixed fracture structure of transcrystalline with
regional ductile dimples (Fig. 6 a (iv)), due to the transgranular internal
oxidation [90]. At a tensile temperature of 1073 K, failure occurred even
before the application of external stress. Therefore, we conducted a
long-term high-temperature oxidation test, with the oxidation gain
summarized in Fig. 9 c, showing a linear increase with processing time.
After the high-temperature oxidation process, varieties of oxidation
products were formed, which exhibit different expansion rates during
the growth process. The Pilling-Bedworth ratio (RP− B) of the oxidation
product can be used to evaluate its cracking trend during the oxidation
behavior, expressed as follows [91,92],
RP− B = Vo
n • Vm
= Mo • ρm
n • Mm • ρo
Eq. 5
where M is the molecular mass, ρ denotes the density (base metals with
subscript m and oxides with subscript o), and n is the metallic atomic
number in one molecule. Hence, Nb2O5 and V2O5 have RP− B values
higher than 2, which are 2.665 and 3.240, respectively. This indicates
that the oxidation film containing N2O5 and V2O5, with RP− B values
higher than 2, is prone to expand and crack, leading to the formation of
loose oxidation film after the hot temperature oxidation process [93]. As
a result, surface cracks formed spontaneously (Fig. 9 a) and severe
cleavage also occurred in the 120-h oxidized T42 sample (Fig S 3 in SI)
during the high-temperature oxidation test, indicating the need for a
stable and thick oxide layer formation element in the future [7].
5. Conclusions
In this study, the T42 RHEA was successfully synthesized using the
LENS approach, and its microstructure, high-temperature tensile prop￾erties, lattice distortion, and high-temperature elastic constants were
thoroughly investigated. The main conclusions are as follows.
1) The LENS-fabricated T42 alloy exhibited a large local lattice strain of
3.68 %, detected via the PDF approach, attributed to the presence of
a large radius mismatch and local chemical fluctuations. These fac￾tors contribute to the excellent yield strength at room temperature.
2) As the temperature increases, the fabricated T42 alloy demonstrates
stable yield strengths ranging from 680 to 635 MPa in the elevated
temperature range. The modulus of the fabricated T42 alloy shows
low sensitivity to temperature, enabling it to overcome heat soft￾ening at elevated temperatures. The effect of lattice distortion re￾mains significant, providing considerable yield strength compared to
other RHEAs under certain temperature ranges.
3) However, increasing the working temperature to 1073 K results in
severe oxidation without the formation of a solid oxidation layer,
leading to the complete fracture of the fabricated T42 alloy in our
study. This highlights the need to consider the addition of elements
that can promote the formation of solid oxidation films in future
studies.
