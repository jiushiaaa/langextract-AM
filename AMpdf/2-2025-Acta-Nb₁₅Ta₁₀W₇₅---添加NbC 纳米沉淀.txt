ABSTRACT
The inherent brittleness of the refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) renders manufacturing of 
structural components with complex geometries using conventional means difficult. The additive manufacturing 
technique of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can potentially circumvent this problem. However, eliminating 
cracks, minimizing porosity, reducing the microstructural and (consequent) mechanical anisotropy, and 
retaining high-temperature (HT) strength—all simultaneously—remain the key challenges. Adding ceramic 
particles to the alloy can improve the printability and HT strength. However, the extreme melting points of 
RMPEAs can lead to their dissolution. Keeping this in view, 1.5 at. % WC powder—determined theoretically to be 
the optimum—was added to the Nb15Ta10W75 powders prior to LPBF. Results show an expanded process window 
and improved printability, attributed to the enhanced laser absorptivity, without compromising powder flow￾ability. Carbon released through the dissolution of WC combines with Nb to form NbC in-situ, which promotes in 
the columnar-to-equiaxed microstructural transition and hence reduced mechanical anisotropy. The NbC nano￾precipitates also enhance the high temperature strength (up to 1600 ◦C) by hindering the mobility of both screw 
and edge dislocations.
1. Introduction
The advent of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) has opened 
the arena of alloy design to a vast multicomponent space and enabled 
the identification of alloys with prominent properties for various ap￾plications[1–4]. Specifically, the refractory multi-principal element al￾loys (RMPEAs) exhibit excellent high-temperature (HT) strength and 
resistance to HT softening, making them potential candidates in a wide 
variety of high temperature applications [5–8]. Among RMPEAs re￾ported thus far, NbMoTaW exhibits promising phase stability, resistance 
to softening at HT, and HT strength (~400 MPa at 1600 ◦C), far 
exceeding the service temperature of Ni-based superalloys [9]. While it 
is particularly suitable for HT pressure-bearing components, its intrinsic 
brittleness severely limits the application potential as producing com￾ponents with complex shapes is difficult [10]. The additive 
manufacturing technique of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) enables the 
direct fabrication of such components, overcoming the limitations (such 
as restricted mold shapes and poor processability) of arc melting 
[11–13]. However, two critical challenges remain for LPBF of NbMo￾TaW. First, the inherent brittleness of NbMoTaW could induce cracking

under the high thermal gradients intrinsic to LPBF, making defect 
elimination particularly challenging [14]. Second, columnar grains 
preferentially form along the [001] or [101] crystallographic directions 
during LPBF, resulting in anisotropy that could adversely affect practical 
applications [15,16]. These challenges are addressed—primarily—by 
adding low-melting-point elements or ceramic particles to RMPEAs.
Incorporating low melting point (MP) elements (e.g., Ti, Zr, or Hf 
with the melting points of 1670, 1852, and 2227 ◦C, respectively) 
significantly enhances the constitutional undercooling (ΔTCS). It, in turn, 
provides the driving force for heterogeneous nucleation and thus sup￾presses the columnar grain growth during LPBF [17,18]. However, 
alloying with elements with lower MP reduces the plastic flow softening 
temperature and promotes the transition of dislocation-mediated plastic 
deformation from that governed by cross-kinking to that of diffusion, 
thereby adversely affecting the HT strength [19–21]. It also could 
adversely affect the printability during LPBF. The significant thermo￾dynamic differences (e.g., melting point, viscosity, and thermal expan￾sion coefficient) between the high and low MP elements narrow the 
processing window and increase the risk of segregation-induced 
cracking owing to the increased volatility of low MP elements [21–23].
The addition of ceramic particles to alloys during LPBF can enhance 
heterogeneous nucleation, suppress columnar grains, and hinder dislo￾cation mobility during HT deformation of the alloy [24]. The ceramic 
particles can also improve printability through the following possible 
mechanisms. They could (i) refine grains, which could help resist crack 
formation [25], (ii) lower the melt viscosity, which would promote the 
molten metal flow in filling the pores [26], (iii) enhance wettability that 
would facilitate stronger interlayer bonding [27], and (iv) alleviate the 
tensile stresses generated during solidification by ceramic-induced 
compressive stress to suppress cracking [28]. The effectiveness of 
these mechanisms depends critically on the survival of ceramic particles 
within the melt pools of LPBF, as the high MP of RMPEA poses the risk of 
ceramic particle dissolution.
Keeping the above in mind, this work selectively incorporates nano￾sized carbide particles into Nb15Ta10W75 powders to improve print￾ability by enhancing laser absorptivity. It also utilizes in-situ precipita￾tion during LPBF to reduce the anisotropy and improve the room 
temperature (RT)/HT strengths. The roles of carbide particles and in-situ 
precipitates are further summarized in Supplementary-Note 1. This 
strategy effectively addresses the thermal stability limitations of ceramic 
particles in improving printability and HT strength in RMPEAs. 
Nb15Ta10W75 alloy was chosen as the matrix, as it was optimized from 
the Nb-Mo-Ta-W alloy systems using the Toda-Caraballo model and 
demonstrated to exhibit an excellent HT strength of 640 MPa at 1600 ◦C 
[29]. The selection of ceramic particles involved the following three 
steps. (i) The type of non-metallic element within ceramic particles was 
determined by evaluating the solid solubility and melting point (ob￾tained from the equilibrium phase diagram) of its in-situ formed com￾pounds. (ii) The optimum ceramic content to be added was determined 
based on the critical re-precipitation amount (obtained from the 
non-equilibrium solidification path calculations) to ensure in-situ 
nano-precipitate formation during LPBF. (iii) The ceramic type was 
selected by evaluating mixed powder characteristics (including laser 
absorptivity and flowability), which can minimize the impact of the 
ceramic addition on the powder spreading characteristics and improve 
printing quality. The formation mechanisms of the NbC 
nano-precipitates, as well as their effects on microstructural evolution 
and RT/HT mechanical properties, were investigated in detail. Notably, 
the impact of NbC nano-precipitates on the screw/edge dislocation 
mobility at high temperatures is evaluated.
2. Materials and methodologies
2.1. Material design and powder mixing
Since MPs of all the elements in the Nb15Ta10W75 alloy are high, it is 
difficult to achieve a large degree of ΔTCS. Adding suitable ceramic 
particles, which would act as the heterogenous nucleation cites, is 
essential for achieving the columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) in it 
[13]. Since the high MP of Nb15Ta10W75 can result in the dissolution of 
the added particles, the key strategy employed here is to add ceramic 
powders that can dissolve in the melt pools and, in the process, intro￾duce a non-metallic element to the melt, which subsequently 
re-precipitate in-situ and regulates the grain morphology. The phase 
stability of the in-situ formed precipitates is an additional consideration 
that is crucial for maintaining grain morphology and strength of the 
alloy at HT. To this end, the solid solubility and melting points of various 
in-situ precipitations were assessed using an equilibrium phase diagram 
obtained from the Thermo-Calc software. An example of it is displayed 
in Fig. 1(a). It shows that with the incorporation of 0.25 at. % C into 
Nb15Ta10W75, the matrix phase with the body centered cubic (BCC) 
crystal structure first solidifies, followed by the metal carbide (MC) 
phase at 2613 ◦C, with a maximum molar fraction of 1.1 %. Similar 
equilibrium phase diagrams were obtained when C, N, B, or O in 
different proportions were introduced into Nb15Ta10W75, which all 
consist of BCC phase and in-situ precipitates (MC, MN, MB, or MO, 
respectively). The precipitation temperatures of MC, MN, MB, and MO 
are displayed in Fig. 1(b), and the maximum re-precipitation contents 
after adding different contents of C, N, B, or O into Nb15Ta10W75 matrix 
are shown in Fig. 1(c). The MC phase has the highest precipitation 
temperature (the best phase stability) and re-precipitation content (the 
lowest solid solubility) compared to the MN, MB, and MO type pre￾cipitates. Therefore, it is inferred that adding C to Nb15Ta10W75 aids in 
the in-situ formation precipitates and contributes to the phase stability.
To ensure the in-situ MC precipitation during LPBF, the non￾equilibrium solidification paths of (Nb15Ta10W75)100− xCx (x = 0, 1.0, 
1.5 at. %) at a cooling rate of 107 K/s were estimated using the Gulliver￾Scheil model module (available in the Thermo-calc software) to deter￾mine the amount of C that needs to be added. Results are displayed in 
Figs.1 (d1-d2). The Gulliver-Scheil model is suitable for simulating the 
non-equilibrium solidification process that occurs under the rapid so￾lidification conditions which prevail during the LPBF process [30]. This 
model assumes that complete diffusion occurs within the liquid phase, 
while no diffusion occurs in the solid phase [30]. Figures.1 (d1-d2) show 
that the solidification sequence remains liquid (L)→ BCC phase as long 
as the added C content is below 1.5 at. %. It changes to L→ BCC→ 
BCC+MC when more than 1.5 at. % C. Therefore, incorporating more 
than 1.5 at. % C to Nb15Ta10W75 is deemed beneficial for in-situ MC 
precipitation during LPBF.
While increasing the C content beyond 1.5 at. % can contribute 
positively to the precipitate formation during LPBF, it also could 
adversely affect the powder flowability, as it reduces the smoothness of 
the powder surfaces and thus enhances the rolling friction between the 
powder particles [31]. For determining the optimal type of carbide 
ceramic additions, the flowability and laser absorptivity of Nb15Ta10W75 
powders mixed with different ceramic powder contents were assessed. 
The detailed selection process is shown in Supplementary-Note 2, and 
only the best results are presented below.
The required quantities of elemental powders (Nb, Ta, W, > 99.9 % 
purity, Xiamen Tungsten Co.,Ltd., China) for forming Nb15Ta10W75 were 
accurately weighed using an electronic analytical balance. The pre￾mixed powders were put into a mixing tank and evacuated to a vac￾uum of 10–1 Pa before filling it with the argon gas. The pre-mixed 
powder was then mixed at 120 r/min for 6 h in a three-dimensional 
(3D) planetary mill. A laser diffraction analyzer (DC24000 UHR, CPS, 
Inc.) was used to measure the equivalent diameter of the powders. The 
D10, D50, and D90 of the Nb15Ta10W75 powders were 20, 37, and 57 μm, 
respectively. The powders display a spherical morphology, as shown in 
Figs.2 (a1) and (b1). Then, WC powder was added to the Nb15Ta10W75 
powder such that the C content in the combined alloy corresponds to 1.5 
% of the total at %; this alloy is referred to as (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 
hereafter. The WC powder size follows the Gaussian distribution and

was found to be uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the 
Nb15Ta10W75 powders after being mixed in a planetary mill for 5 h, as 
shown in Figs. 2(a2) and (b2). The flowability of powders, which is 
crucial for printing quality, was evaluated by using the Hall flowmeter 
[32]. Both the Hall flow rate (HRF) and the angle of repose (AOR) did 
not show significant changes after the incorporation of WC powders, as 
shown in Figs.2 (c1-c2), indicating that it will not affect the powder flow 
and spread.
Apart from powder flowability, laser absorptivity also significantly 
influences print quality. The addition of smaller WC particles to the 
Nb15Ta10W75 powder increases its convex and specific surface areas and 
thus could enhance its laser absorptivity and reduce the energy required 
for melting powders [32]. To ascertain this, the laser absorptivity was 
measured using the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, UV–vis-NIR 
Lambda 950 Spectrophotometer, PerkinElmer, Inc.). The laser absorp￾tivity of the (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 powders is 88 % higher (at a wave￾length of 1070 nm used for the LPBF process) than that of the 
Nb15Ta10W75 powders, as shown in Figs.2 (d1-d2). Thus, incorporation 
of 1.5 at. % WC powders into Nb15Ta10W75 aids in the in-situ precipi￾tation as well as fabrication using LPBF.
2.2. Material preparation
The LPBF processes were carried in an SLM 280 metal printer (Zhong 
Rui Technique, China), which was equipped with a maximum laser 
power of 500 W (YAG fiber laser; beam spot diameter 90 μm; wave￾length 1070 nm). The process chamber was filled with high-purity argon 
(99.999 vol %; oxygen content below 100 ppm) and shielded the sam￾Fig. 1. (a) Equilibrium phase diagram and element compositions of Nb15Ta10W75 doped with non-metallic elements. (b) Precipitation temperatures of MC, MN, MB,

ples from oxidation. A rotation angle of 67 ◦ between successive layers 
was applied to reduce stress and anisotropy. A polished pure tungsten 
plate was used as the substrate to improve the bonding with the mate￾rial. The melting points of Nb, Mo, Ta, and W all exceeded 2400 ◦C [8], 
requiring high energy input to melt the powders during LPBF 
completely. To analyze the influence of WC powder addition on the 
optimum printing process parameter window of Nb15Ta10W75, a series 
of samples were printed using different volumetric energy densities 
(VED) [33]: 
VED = P
vht. (1) 
In Eq. (1), P is laser power, v is the scanning speed, h is the hatch 
spacing, and t is the layer thickness. A total of 480 process parameter 
combinations, with the VED and P ranges of 50 to 850 J/mm3 and 150 to 
400 W, respectively, for each composition were explored. In all cases, t 
was fixed at 40 μm, while h was either 30 or 40 μm, v was adjusted 
accordingly based on the above parameters. Based on these trails, the 
following optimum process parameter combination for Nb15Ta10W75 
was identified: P = 300 W, v = 400 mm/s, t = 40 μm, and h = 30 μm. 
With the addition of 1.5 at. % WC powder, a v of 690 mm/s (while the 
other three process parameters remained the same) gave the best results.
A gas expansion density tester (HX-TD, Hiseel, China) was used to 
measure the relative density of the printed samples. This device 
measured the variation in helium gas volume within the test chamber 
before and after placing the sample, providing an efficient, accurate, and 
non-destructive method to measure the true volume and density of the 
printed samples. To ensure measurement accuracy, the printed samples 
were successively polished using the 500 #, 1000 #, 1500 #, 2000 # and 
3000 # grit sandpapers to minimize the influence of irregular surface 
contours. For each printing parameter combination, nine samples were 
printed, and their density was measured, with each sample tested 3 
times to ensure the reliability of the results. Cubic samples of 8 × 8 × 10 
mm3 were printed and used for density measurement, microstructural 
characterization, and compression experiments.
2.3. Microstructural and mechanical characterization
The crystal structure of the phase(s) in the microstructure was 
analyzed by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD; D8 Advance Da Vinci, 
Bruker Corp., USA) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) 
operating at 40 kV, 40 mA, and performed over a scan range of 20 ◦ and 
100 ◦ with a scan rate of 1.5 ◦/min. The defect characteristics of the 
printed samples were characterized using an optical microscope (OM; 
Axio Imager A2m, Zeiss, Germany). Microstructural characteristics and 
powder morphology were observed with the aid of a scanning electron 
microscope (SEM; FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA). It was equipped with the 
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffrac￾tion (EBSD) detectors, which were used to analyze the microscopic 
segregation and the grain orientation, respectively. The EBSD experi￾ments were performed at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with a scan 
step size of 0.1 μm. The finer microstructures and precipitates were 
observed by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-F200X, 
JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) working at a voltage of 200 kV. For TEM, foils 
were prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB; Carl Zeiss AG) equipped with 
an electron beam at 100 kV. The elemental distribution within the 
precipitates was characterized using the 3D-atom probe tomography 
(3D-APT; LEAP 5000X), operating at a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz 
and a UV laser energy of 60 pJ. The sharp tipped samples for 3D-APT 
were fabricated by annular milling within the grains using FIB.
Uniaxial compression experiments were performed in a universal 
testing machine (Sans Testing Machine Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) 
equipped with a video extensometer (LVE-MICRO30) at a nominal 
constant loading rate of 0.008 mm/s. The size of compression specimens 
was Ф2 mm × 4 mm. At least three samples were tested for each case. 
The HT compression properties were measured by using a Gleeble-3500 
testing machine, with a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min and a constant 
displacement rate (εL) of 0.0025 mm/s. The size of HT compression 
specimens was Ф4 mm × 8 mm.
3. Results
3.1. Sample preparation
Results of the defect morphologies of the printed samples, charac￾terized using OM, and their relative densities, measured using a gas 
expansion density tester, are shown in Fig. 3(a). For VED below 310 
J•mm-3, lack of fusion (LOF) pores were observed in both Nb15Ta10W75 
and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. They are likely due to inadequate heat input 
for fully melting refractory metal powders [34,35]. When VED exceeded 
620 J•mm-3, cracks were observed in both RMPEAs. Cracking is thought 
to be driven by the accumulation of thermal stresses, caused by the 
excessive energy input [23]. The optimal VED ranges for Nb15Ta10W75 
and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 were found to be 520–620 J•mm-3 and 
360–520 J•mm-3, which resulted in the densities of 99.2 ± 0.15 % and 
99.5 ± 0.1 %, respectively, with pores being the only type of defects 
present in the blocks fabricated using these parameters. The incorpo￾ration of WC powders not only led to a higher density—that too at a 
lower VED, but also a wider process window (extended by 50 J•mm-3), 
compared to Nb15Ta10W75, possibly due to the enhanced laser absorp￾tivity (Fig. 2(d2)). Cuboidal samples (8 × 8 × 10 mm3
) of both the alloys 
were manufactured with the optimal process (mentioned in Section 2.2) 
and are used for microstructure characterization and compression ex￾periments, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
3.2. Microstructural characterization
The XRD patterns obtained on Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 are shown in Fig. 4. The pattern obtained on 
Nb15Ta10W75 shows a single phase with the BCC crystal structure. With 
the incorporation of WC powder, additional peaks corresponding to the 
NbC precipitates with B2 crystal structure are observed. The dislocation 
density (ρ) within the built samples was estimated using the XRD data 
and the following equations [36,37]: 
ρ = 2 ̅̅̅
3
√ ϑ
ψb (2) 
ϑ = β
4tanθ (3) 
ψ = Kλ
βcosθ (4) 
where ϑ is the micro-strain (which is related to the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, β [38]), ψ is the coherent domain 
size (that depends on the X-ray wavelength, λ = 0.15405 nm [38,39]), b 
is the Burgers vector, θ is the Bragg angle, and K is a dimensionless factor 
(= 0.89 [39]). Details of the calculations used for estimating ρ based on 
the XRD data are provided in Supplementary-Note 3. The estimated ρ 
values in Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 are about 3.36 ± 0.2 
× 1014 and 3.96 ± 0.3 × 1014 m− 2
, respectively.
Figs. 5 (a1–a4) display the SEM images of the X-Y and X-Z planes of 
Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. They show few pores and no 
cracks, confirming the high relative densities and good quality prints. 
The inverse pole figure (IPF) maps (overlapped with the high-angle 
grain boundaries (HAGBs) for showing grain morphologies) are dis￾played in Figs. 5 (b1-b4). Generally, the misorientation angles between 
neighboring grains exceed 15◦ for HAGBs, while the low-angle grain 
boundaries (LAGBs) are those grain boundaries (GBs) with misorienta￾tion angles between 2◦ and 15◦ [40]. In the X-Y plane, both the alloys do 
not exhibit significant columnar grain morphology. In the X-Z plane, 
Nb15Ta10W75 exhibits a columnar grain morphology, with the long axis 
R. Duan et al. Acta Materialia 297 (2025) 121325
4
of the grains oriented along the Z-axis direction. This is due to the sig￾nificant temperature gradient along the Z-axis, which leads to the for￾mation of columnar grains aligned with it [39].
To further identify the grain morphology, the grain shape aspect 
ratio (GSAR) is analyzed, as shown in Figs.5 (c1-c4). The GSAR is defined 
as the ratio of the short to long axis of the grains, with distinct colors 
used to differentiate grain morphologies. Both Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibit cellular grain morphology on the X-Y 
plane. The GSAR values are closely concentrated in the range of 0.3–0.6, 
comprising 66.3 % for Nb15Ta10W75 and 63.5 % for 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, as shown in Figs.5 (c1) and (c3). The GSAR of 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 on the X-Z plane increases significantly compared 
to that of Nb15Ta10W75, particularly in the range of 0.3–0.6, rising from 
35.5 % to 71.0 %, as shown in Figs.5 (c2) and (c4). This indicates a 
significant increase in short axis grains, and the addition of WC powders 
effectively inhibits the growth of columnar grains. Besides, GSAR maps 
over a larger area (500 µm × 600 µm) on the X-Z plane were obtained to 
further distinguish grain morphology (Figs.5 (d1-d2)). The results indi￾cate that (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 has a higher GSAR value, with a high 
proportion of 69.9 % at 0.3–0.6 and 8.7 % at 0.6–1.0, indicating the WC 
powder addition suppresses the columnar grain growth and results in an 
equiaxed microstructure.
Except for grain morphology, the pole figures (PFs) also confirm that 
the addition of WC powders suppresses the columnar grain growth, as 
shown in Figs.5 (e1-e4). In the X-Y plane, random texture is noted for 
both the alloys (Fig. 5(e1) and (e3)). The maximum uniform distribution 
(MUD) values are 2.93 and 2.83 for Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, respectively. In the X-Z plane of Nb15Ta10W75, 
strong {100} texture can be observed (Fig. 5(e2)), which is the preferred 
grain growth direction during LPBF [10,11]. The corresponding MUD 
value is 3.29. With the WC powder addition, significant reduction in the 
intensity of {100} texture is noted, making the texture random (Fig. 5
(e4)). Correspondingly, the MUD value decreased to 3.02.
Bright-field (BF) TEM images obtained from the Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 samples are shown in Figs.6 (a1) and (a2), 
respectively. (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 contains a large number of 
dispersed precipitates, which were uniformly distributed both within 
the grains and at the GBs. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) 
patterns of Nb15Ta10W75, obtained using the [01–1]BCC zone axis, and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 along the [1-31]BCC zone axis, are shown in Figs.6 
(b1) and (b2), respectively. Nb15Ta10W75 exhibits only a BCC structure 
without any second phase. In contrast, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 displays 
an additional set of diffraction spots, which correspond to the B2 crystal 
structure, indicating the in-situ formation of MC precipitates. The phase 
structures observed from the SAED patterns are consistent with the XRD 
results shown in Fig. 4. An EDS line scan, performed on the nano￾precipitates inside the grains (red dashed box), is shown in Fig. 6(c). 
The C and Nb contents are the highest in the center of the nano-scale 
precipitate, while other elements are significantly lower. Especially, 
the W content is significantly lower in the precipitate than in the matrix, 
whereas Ta content is nearly constant. The elemental distribution con￾firms that the observed particles are indeed NbC nano-precipitates, with 
the length and width of about 67 ± 5 and 45 ± 4 nm, respectively.
Fig.6(d) displays the TEM dark-field (DF) micrographs of the NbC 
precipitates within (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, which is obtained along the 
[222]NbC zone axis (Fig. 6(e)). The results show that a considerable 
number of precipitates are uniformly distributed in the alloy. Based on 
the DF-TEM images, the average diameter (r) of these precipitates 
(measured using the Image-Pro-Plus software) is determined to be 37.2 
± 4.3 nm (Fig. 6(f)). Their number density (N) was estimated by using 
the following equations [40]: 
N = f

(6) 
Tavg = 1.15R(1) + 2.07R(2) + 2.99R(3) + 3.91R(4) (7) 
where f is the volume fraction. Tavg is the average thickness of NbC, 
taken across four different locations (R(i)) of the TEM sample [40], xp 
and yp are the dimensions of the TEM image, and td is the thickness of the 
TEM sample. The obtained N value of the NbC precipitate, 9.7 ± 3.8 ×
1022 m-3, suggests that a large amount of NbC precipitates were uni￾formly dispersed in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 RMPEAs.
For Nb15Ta10W75, the typical atomic structure of the matrix is 
observed from the intragranular region using HRTEM (Fig. 7(a)). The 
HRTEM image of this region is enlarged, and the corresponding Fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) images are shown in Figs.7 (b1) and (b2),

respectively. The selected area exhibits a BCC structure without addi￾tional diffraction spots, consistent with the results of SAED (Fig. 6(b1)). 
The interplanar spacing along [011]BCC was measured as 0.22 nm, 
which corresponds to a lattice parameter of 3.22 Å. Fig. 7(c) shows the 
crystal structures of the matrix, NbC/matrix interface, and NbC in 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. High-magnification HRTEM images and FFT 
patterns of the nano-precipitates are shown in Figs.7 (d1-d2), (e1-e2), and 
(f1-f2), respectively. Only one set of diffraction spots is present in the 
matrix (Fig. 7(d2)) and NbC (Fig. 7(f2)). In contrast, two sets of 
diffraction spots are observed at the NbC/matrix interface (Fig. 7(e2)), 
confirming the phase relationship of [011]BCC//[0–1–1]NbC. The 
measured interplanar spacings of [011]BCC and [011]NbC are 0.224 nm 
(Fig. 7(d1)) and 0.231 nm (Fig. 7(f1)), respectively, with corresponding 
lattice parameters of 3.26 and 3.36 Å. The lattice mismatch (δ) between 
the BCC matrix and NbC nano-precipitates was estimated using the 
following equation [42]:

phases. The lattice mismatch between the BCC matrix and NbC is esti￾mated to be 2.9 % (<5 % [28,41,42]), indicating that the interface be￾tween NbC and the matrix is coherent (Fig. 7(e1)).
3.3. Mechanical properties
Representative compressive engineering stress–strain responses and 
fracture morphologies are shown in Fig. 8. The mechanical properties at 
different temperatures are listed in Table 1. Nb15Ta10W75 displays sig￾nificant mechanical anisotropy, as seen from Figs. 8(a1) and (a2). The 
compressive yield strength (σ0.2), ultimate compressive strength (σm), 
and fracture strain (ε) at RT and parallel to BD are 759 ± 17 MPa, 939 ±
16 MPa, and 2.6 ± 0.2 %, respectively. Perpendicular to BD, they are 
1409 ± 22 MPa, 1520 ± 13 MPa, and 5.3 ± 0.3 %, respectively. The σ0.2 
and ε values in the direction perpendicular to BD are nearly-double of 
those along BD, illustrating significant anisotropy. In contrast, incor￾porating WC powder into Nb15Ta10W75 effectively eliminates the me￾chanical anisotropy due to CET (Fig. 5). In addition, σ0.2, σm, and ε along 
BD increased significantly to 1591 ± 25 MPa, 1667 ± 13 MPa, and 7.4 ±
0.1 %, respectively. Perpendicular to BD, they increased to 1615 ± 28 
MPa, 1692 ± 21 MPa, and 8.3 ± 0.4 %, respectively. Note that σ0.2 and ε 
of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 in the two orientations are nearly the same.
The fractographs obtained from the specimens tested in different 
orientations are shown in Figs.8 (b1-b4). For Nb15Ta10W75, fractographs 
of specimens tested along BD show cleavage fracture characteristics, 
with relatively smooth surfaces and river patterns (Fig. 8(b1)). When 
compressed in the direction perpendicular to BD, the fractured surface 
exhibits a mixture of cleavage and quasi-cleavage fracture characteris￾tics (Fig. 8(b3)). After adding WC powder, the fracture mechanism 
across both compression directions transitions to quasi-cleavage frac￾ture, exhibiting a greater number of torn edges (Figs.8 (b2) and (b4)).
The stress–strain responses of Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, with the compression direction perpendicular to 
BD, at HT are shown in Figs.8 (c1-c4). At 1000, 1200, and 1400 ◦C, the 
stress-strain curves for Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibit 
elastic deformation before fracture, with some limited plasticity only 
observed at 1600 ◦C. This is probably due to the transition from cross￾kinking to a diffusion-controlled dislocation slip mechanism at higher 
temperatures, facilitating dislocation slip and hence plastic deformation 
[43]. More importantly, σ0.2 of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 over the temper￾ature range of 1000 and 1600 ◦C exceed those of Nb15Ta10W75 by about 
100 MPa. The mechanical test results indicate that the incorporation of 
WC powder into Nb15Ta10W75 can eliminate anisotropy, improve RT 
plasticity, and enhance strength at both RT and HT.
4. Discussion
4.1. Formation mechanisms of the NbC precipitates
From Fig. 6, it is obvious that the WC particles added to the RMPEA 
powder completely dissolves during the LPBF process, and then lead to 
the formation of the NbC nano-precipitates within the matrix. These 
precipitates suppress the columnar grain growth, and, in turn, reduce 
the mechanical anisotropy (Figs. 5 and 8). It is well known that in-situ

precipitation during LPBF facilitates CET [44]. Therefore, the mecha￾nisms responsible for the NbC formation in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 need 
elucidation, which is attempted in the following through a comparative 
analysis of the physical characteristics and precipitation kinetics.
Generally, a lower mixing enthalpy (ΔHmix) indicates a stronger af￾finity between the elements, which favors the formation of stable 
compounds during LPBF [45]. The values of ΔHmix of Nb, Ta, and W with 
C are shown in Fig. 9(a). Amongst them, Nb-C exhibits the lowest ΔHmix, 
compared to Ta-C and W-C, suggesting a strong preference for forming 
NbC. This observation rationalizes their in-situ formation during LPBF of 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. Notably, the comparison of ΔHmix values among 
metallic compounds provides a meaningful starting point for the kinetic 
calculations (including precipitate nucleation and growth), ensuring 
that the predicted phase was the most thermodynamically favorable 
one, while ruling out metastable phases (for example, ΔHmix for W-C is 
− 60 kJ/mol). The nucleation of precipitates is predominantly influ￾enced by the thermodynamic driving force (ΔG*), which influences the 
nucleation rate (Nv) [46,47]. Using the Thermo-Calc software, values for 
ΔG* and Nv of the BCC and NbC phases that are included in the 
non-equilibrium solidification curve 2 of Fig. 1(d2) are obtained. Results 
are shown in Figs.9 (b-c). The maximum ΔG* value of NbC (6177 J) is 
nearly-seven times that of the BCC phase (851 J), resulting in Nv for NbC 
being about 107 times higher than that for BCC phase. On this basis, it is 
reasonable to assume that NbC nucleates rapidly (even at high cooling 
rates (107 K/s) that prevail during LPBF).
The diffusion coefficient (ς) also plays a critical role in the nucleation 
and growth of NbC [48]. The ς values of Nb, Ta, W, and C are estimated 
using the following equation [49]: 
ς = ς0exp(−
RT
QD
)
(9) 
where ς0 is the intrinsic diffusion coefficient (m2
/s) and QD is the acti￾vation energy for diffusion (kJ/mol). These parameters are obtained 
from literature through experiments or simulations of refractory metals 
composed of Nb, Ta, and W [49], and listed in Table 2. The 
temperature-dependence of ς for Nb, Ta, W, and C is shown in Fig. 9(d). 
The results indicate that C has significantly higher ς than the metallic 
elements across different temperatures, which would also facilitate the 
in-situ formation of carbides including NbC. Overall, the small ΔHmix as 
well as large ΔG*, Nv, ς of NbC, are possibly the reasons that ensure the 
nucleation and growth of NbC during LPBF.
Variations in the phase volume fractions and element contents under 
the conditions of non-equilibrium solidification (107 K/s) are analyzed 
to further explore the origin of in-situ formed NbC. The non-equilibrium 
cooling path containing NbC is shown in Fig. 10(a), which is derived 
from stage 2 of the non-equilibrium cooling curve depicted in Fig. 1(d2). 
The variations in the volume fractions of the liquid, BCC and NbC phases 
with the temperature are shown in Fig. 10(b). As the temperature de￾creases from 2755 to 2680 ◦C at a cooling rate of 107 K/s, the liquid 
phase simultaneously transforms into BCC and NbC phases. Within this 
temperature range, the formation temperature of NbC (2740 ◦C) slightly 
lags behind that of the BCC phase (2753 ◦C), with higher ΔG*, Nv, and ς 
values promoting the transformation. The phase transformation path￾ways are governed by elemental redistribution. Therefore, the Ther￾moCalc software was employed to calculate the compositional 
variations under non-equilibrium cooling conditions (107 K/s). Results, 
shown in Figs.10 (c1-c4), indicate that, during the formation of NbC, C

and Nb rapidly diffuse to it in the liquid phase, reaching 18.5 and 68.5 
at. %, respectively. On the other hand, W segregates to the BCC phase, 
reaching 78.4 %. Ta is relatively uniformly distributed in both the 
phases, with concentrations of 15.9 and 8.5 at. %, respectively. The 
combination of (i) rapid cooling process of LPBF [13], (ii) the low 
diffusion rate of refractory metals (Fig. 9(d)), and (iii) the minimal 
variation in elemental composition during non-equilibrium solidifica￾tion (Fig. 10 (c1-c4)), result in the preservation of precipitate composi￾tions that essentially mirrors the initial solidification composition of 
liquid pools. Therefore, measurement of the composition of NbC pre￾cipitate and comparing it with the composition calculated by 
Thermo-Calc can effectively confirm the source of the precipitate.
For verifying the Thermo-Calc results experimentally, APT 
experiments were performed to determine the composition of the NbC 
nano-precipitates, after preparing the samples by FIB and identifying the 
precipitate locations using TEM (Fig. 10(d)). Results indicate significant 
aggregation of C and Nb in NbC, while W is absent (Figs.10 (e1-e4)). To 
identify NbC and quantify the elemental distributions, a surface with a C 
concentration of 0.15 at. % is constructed (Fig. 10(f)), and a one￾dimensional (1D) composition map perpendicular to this surface is 
created (Fig. 10(g)). The elemental content in NbC obtained from APT is 
consistent with the Thermo-Calc predictions (Fig. 10(h)), which con￾firms the accuracy of non-equilibrium solidification calculations, indi￾cating that NbC originates from the liquid phase. As the temperature 
reaches the precipitation range for NbC (2680 to 2755 ◦C), the combi￾nation of low ΔHmix and high ΔG*, Nv, ς values promotes Nb and C atoms

to rapidly aggregate resulting in the nucleation of NbC from the liquid 
phase. During LPBF, the added WC particles dissolve into the molten 
pool first, followed by the distribution of C throughout the liquid alloy, 
and subsequent precipitation of NbC from the liquid phase upon solid￾ification. This process circumvents the uneven distribution and 
agglomeration of secondary particles, which is a common phenomenon 
otherwise [50].
4.2. Effect of the NbC precipitates on the grain structure
To analyze the effects of the in-situ formed NbC on the grain shape, 
especially on the planes along BD (X-Z and Y-Z), the grain boundary 
distributions are obtained and plotted in Figs.11 (a1-a4). Based on these 
images, the size of the irregular grains is measured using two different 
(line intercept and area measurement) methods. The line intercept 
method measures the average size of grains intersected by a line, while 
the area measurement method estimates the average grain size based on 
the grain’s area. The equations for these methods are the following [51]: 
dLine = 1
Ng
∑Ng
i=1
di (10) 
dArea = 2
∑Ng
i=1Ai • (Ai/π)
1/2
∑Ng
i=1Ai (11) 
where dLine is the average grain size obtained by the line intercept 
method, Ng is the total number of grains, di is the length for grain i, dArea 
is the average grain size obtained by the area method, Ai is the area of 
grain i, and 2(Ai/π)
1/2 is the equivalent diameter based on the area of 
grain i. By comparing grain size values obtained by the line intercept 
method along the X direction (for the width of columnar grains), along 
the Z direction (for the length of columnar grains), and by the area 
method (for the averaged size of columnar grains), the impact of WC 
particles on the size of the columnar grains could be revealed. The grain 
size on X-Z plane decrease from 7.34 ± 1.3 µm in Nb15Ta10W75 to 6.10 ±
0.9 µm in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, as shown in Fig. 11(b) (similar trend 
can be seen for the X-Y plane as well, as shown in Supplementary-Note 
4). Figs.11(c) and (d) show the grain size distributions with the mea￾surement line directions oriented perpendicular or parallel to the Z-axis, 
respectively. The vertical grain size (10.4 µm) in Nb15Ta10W75 exceeds 
the horizontal one (6.72 µm), typical of columnar grain morphology. 
The grain size in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 decreases to 6.46 µm in the 
horizontal direction and 5.98 µm in the vertical direction, displaying a 
much more equiaxed morphology than in Nb15Ta10W75. These results 
further confirm that the NbC precipitates not only inhibit the columnar 
grain growth during LPBF, but also lead to the refinement of the grains.
The influence of NbC and corresponding process parameters on the 
suppression of columnar grains is analyzed using the inter-dependence 
model, which effectively evaluates the synergetic effect of alloy 
composition, nucleation efficiency, and interparticle distance on grain 
refinement [52,53]. This model has been widely used to evaluate grain 
size in alloys produced using casting [54], welding [55], and additive 
manufacturing [56]. The interdependence model and the key control 
parameters of grain size can be expressed as following [57]:

Xcs is the critical distance that grains must grow before producing 
adequate ΔTCS to initiate subsequent nuclei, D is the diffusion coefficient 
of the solute in the liquid, z is the fraction of ΔTcs required for hetero￾geneous nucleation, v is the laser scanning speed, ΔTcs is the under￾cooling of critical nucleation, CE is the elasticity coefficient, ΔSv is the 
entropy of fusion per unit volume, and δ is the degree of interfacial 
lattice parameter match between the nucleating particles and the ma￾trix. ΔTn is closely related to δ between nucleating particles and matrix. 
A smaller δ lowers ΔTn is required for the activation of heterogeneous 
nucleation processes, i.e., ΔTn ∝ δ [52]. Q is a growth restriction factor; 
mi is the slope of the liquidus line for the i
th solute in the alloy; ki and C0,i 
are the partition coefficient and solute concentration, respectively. Xdl is 
the diffusion field distance of accumulated solutes that can compensate 
for insufficient ΔTcs due to solute diffusion at the S/L interface and is 
directly related to Q values. Xsd is the average distance from Xdl to the 
nearest particle that can effectively nucleate. It is closely related to the 
effective nucleation particle density and can be evaluated through 
undercooling. When ΔTn is lower than the undercooling at the solid/￾liquid interface (ΔT), numerous heterogeneous nucleation events are 
activated, reducing Xsd and inhibiting columnar grain formation [58]. 
Xsd is positively correlated with ΔT and negatively correlated with ΔTn. 
ΔT is composed of ΔTcs and thermal undercooling (ΔTt) under 
non-equilibrium solidification conditions [58]. ΔTcs is primarily associ￾ated with the solute segregation occurring ahead of the solid/liquid 
interface and can be quantitatively evaluated using Q [25]. ΔTt is the 
thermal undercooling when the actual growth rate (Va) at the solid/￾liquid interface lags behind the theoretical pull rate (Vtheo) induced by 
the high cooling rate that prevails during LPBF [58]. Generally, Va is 
directly correlated with laser scanning speed v [53]. φ is the angle (◦)

between the Va and v directions. The degree of ΔTt is controlled by the 
values of v. As the value of v increases, the delay between Va and Vtheo 
becomes more pronounced, resulting in a larger ΔTt.
The comparative evaluation of the solidification distance and 
undercooling illustrates the inhibitory effect of adding WC to RHEA and 
the resulting NbC precipitates on the columnar grains, as shown in 
Fig. 12. The incorporation of WC and the presence of NbC reduces Xcs for 
three reasons. First, NbC being coherent with the matrix (Fig. 7(e1)) 
reduces ΔTn and shorten Xcs. Second, WC powder markedly improves the 
laser absorptivity (Fig. 2(d2)) and increases v (Section 3.1), resulting in 
the shortening of Xcs. Third, C that is released through the dissolution of 
WC increases Q of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 (Table 3), further reducing Xcs. 
Therefore, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibits a smaller Xcs compared to 
Nb15Ta10W75. The Xdl term of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 is slightly smaller 
than that of Nb15Ta10W75 due to higher Q. The presence of NbC also 
reduces Xsd. The coherency between NbC and the matrix also helps 
reduce ΔTn required for heterogeneous nucleation. In Nb15Ta10W75,

heterogeneous nucleation primarily occurs on the native nuclei parti￾cles, such as impurities or oxides that may be present in the melt pool. 
Such nuclei are usually incoherent with the matrix, characterized by 
relatively high δ, leading to larger ΔTn [52]. Besides, the incorporation 
of the WC powders into Nb15Ta10W75 increases ΔTcs owing to the pres￾ence of C in solution, which has a high Q value (Table 3). Simulta￾neously, the added WC powder significantly enhances the laser 
absorptivity in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, thereby increasing v (Section 3.1) 
and ultimately increasing the degree of ΔTt. The incorporation of WC 
and the presence of in-situ NbC nano-precipitates reduce ΔTn while in￾crease ΔT, meeting the nucleation condition of ΔT ≥ ΔTn, which, in turn, 
shortens Xsd for (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. In conclusion, the above theo￾retical analysis made on the basis of the interdependence model in￾dicates that adding WC powder and the in-situ NbC formation reduces 
Xcs, Xdl, and Xsd, which effectively inhibit the columnar grain growth in 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. Moreover, driven by the combination of low 
ΔHmix and high ΔG*, Nv, ς values, NbC particles re-precipitate from the 
liquid phase and are uniformly distributed, which serve as heteroge￾neous nucleation sites and pin grain boundaries (preventing grain 
coarsening) during repeated heating that solidified layers undergo 
during LPBF [52].
4.3. Effect of NbC on the mechanical properties at room temperature
The anisotropy of the mechanical properties at RT is mainly 
controlled by grain morphology [15]. Both as-fabricated Nb15Ta10W75 
and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibit a high relative density of above 99.2 
% (Fig. 3), which minimizes the potential influence of porosity on me￾chanical properties and anisotropy [60,61]. The formation of NbC 
nano-precipitates in the (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 effectively reduces 
anisotropy. During the manufacturing of Nb15Ta10W75 using the LPBF 
technique, the presence of a steep thermal gradient promotes grain 
growth towards the melt pool core [16], ultimately forming a micro￾structure with columnar grains that are parallel to the Z-axis (Figs.5 (c2) 
and (d1)). When the alloy is stressed along the Z-axis, they align with the 
long axis of the columnar grains (Figs.5 (c2) and (d1)). The straight 
boundaries of the columnar grains along their long axis promote crack 
propagation during plastic deformation [59], resulting in poor 
compressibility and strength of 2.6 % and 759 MPa, respectively. In 
contrast, forces applied along the X-axis are parallel to the short axis of 
the columnar grains (Figs.5 (c2) and (d1)). Compared to long-axis 
columnar GBs, short-axis curved boundaries effectively hinder crack 
propagation [59], enhancing compressibility (5.3 %) and strength (1409 
MPa). The incorporation of WC powder into Nb15Ta10W75 induces the 
NbC precipitates (Fig. 7) and changes the grain morphology to an 
equiaxed one (Figs.5 (c4) and (d2)). As a result, the mechanical anisot￾ropy is reduced substantially. In addition, NbC enhances the RT me￾chanical properties. For Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, the 
contributions from solid-solution hardening (ΔσSSH), grain boundary 
strengthening (ΔσGB), dislocation strengthening (ΔσDIS), and precipita￾tion strengthening (ΔσP) to the total yield strength (σy) can be estimated 
using the following relations [62–64]: 
σy = Δσ0 + ΔσSSH + ΔσGB + ΔσDIS + Δσp (22) 
Δσ0 = ∑xiσi (23) 
ΔσGB = Kd− 1/2 (24) 
ΔσDIS = Mαμbρ1/2 (25) 
ΔσP = 0.26 μb
r f 1/2ln(
b
r)
(26) 
where Δσ0 is the lattice friction stress of the matrix which is estimated 
using the weighed average of the lattice friction stresses (σi) of the 
constituent pure metals [64], k is the Hall-Petch slope (210 MPa⋅μm1/2 
for refractory metals [64]), d is the average grain size (estimated using 
the area method on the EBSD data obtained on the X-Z plane (Fig. 11
(b)), M is the Taylor factor (~2.733 for BCC refractory metals) [64], α is 
an empirically determined constant (0.5 for BCC metals [64]), μ is the 
shear modulus calculated according to the mixed weighting equation 
[29], and ρ is obtained from the XRD analysis (Fig. 4). Since dislocations 
cannot cut through the NbC particles because of their large size (>37 
nm) [63], the Orowan looping mechanism is the primary 
precipitation-strengthening mechanism [63], which was used to esti￾mate ΔσP for (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. Due to the rapid cooling rates and 
the small melt pool sizes associated with the LPBF process, it is difficult 
for solutes and solute atoms to rapidly diffuse and generate concentra￾tion gradient over a larger length scale (of micrometer level) [13]
, [65]. 
The Toda-Caraballo model can evaluate the solid-solution hardening 
effect of RMPEAs fabricated using the LPBF process [66]. This model 
overcomes the difficulty of distinguishing "solute-solvent" in the high 
entropy alloys, and utilizes a matrix to calculate lattice distortion caused 
by a small amount of component fluctuations, which is consistent with 
the atomic diffusion behavior under non-equilibrium conditions. ΔσSSH 
was assumed to be the same for Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, as all the added C precipitates out in the form of 
NbC.
The contributions of the different strengthening mechanisms to 
Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 at RT are shown in Fig. 13. 
Their sum, being close to σy obtained from the experiment, renders 
reasonable validity to the methods employed for the estimation. Δσ0 and 
ΔσSSH are the primary contributors to the strength of Nb15Ta10W75, 
providing 430 and 337 MPa respectively, which correspond to 32.9 % 
and 25.8 % of σy [64], respectively. σi of Nb, Ta, and W are 240, 189, and 
550 MPa, respectively. The high proportion of W content in 
Nb15Ta10W75 significantly enhances Δσ0, contributing substantially to 
σy. The severe lattice distortion significantly improves ΔσSSH [29], 
thereby positively contributing to σy.
In (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5, both Δσ0 and ΔσSSH continue to be the 
major strengthening contributors, accounting for 28.3 % and 22.2 % of 
σy, respectively. The strengthening effect of these mechanisms does not 
vary because of negligible variations in the matrix composition. How￾ever, the NbC precipitates generated during LPBF of 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 can pin GBs (from coarsening during the thermal 
cycles of LPBF) and dislocations, thereby refining grains (Fig. 11) and 
increasing ρ (Fig. 4). Benefiting from these microstructural modifica￾tions, ΔσGB and ΔσDIS increase to 269 and 313 MPa, respectively. 
Moreover, the NbC precipitates themselves can also enhance the 
strength by hindering the dislocation mobility, contributing an addi￾tional 167 MPa. Thus, the enhanced strength of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 
mainly arises from the combination of ΔσGB, ΔσDIS, and ΔσP.
Furthermore, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibits superior plasticity (8.3 
%) compared to Nb15Ta10W75 (5.3 %), despite comparable dislocation 
densities in them (Section 3.2). The higher plasticity is also reflected in 
the fracture morphologies (Figs.8 (b3–b4)). This difference in the plastic 
deformability between the two alloys examined is mainly due to the 
differences in microstructure. Specifically, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 con￾tains a higher population of LAGBs than Nb15Ta10W75 (Figs.11(a2) and 
(a4)), which is caused by the pinning effect of precipitates on grain 
boundaries (Fig. 6). The high proportion of LAGBs can blunt the crack 
tips and hinder crack propagation [59], and bear a larger degree of 
deformation before fracture by homogenizing the strain [60], ultimately 
improving plasticity and transforming fracture mechanism from partial 
cleavage to quasi-cleavage.
4.4. Effect of the nano-precipitates on HT mechanical properties
Fig.14(a) compares the HT strengths of Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 with those of other RHEAs reported in literature 
[67–73]. It shows (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exceeds all the others at

various testing temperatures. The softening temperature (Tc) and atomic 
mismatch degree (δr) are important aspects of HT strength of alloys and 
hence can serve as the critical parameters for evaluation [29]. As the 
temperature is increased, a transition in the dominant deformation 
mechanism—from screw to edge dislocation mobility dominated regi￾mes—occurs, and Tc reflects this transition temperature range (usually 
0.3–0.5 times melting temperature) [74,75]. A higher Tc is beneficial for 
maintaining strength at higher temperatures. δr reflects the degree of 
lattice mismatch and is related to the resistance of dislocation movement 
at HT, and can be estimated using the following equation: 
δr = 100

(27) 
where ci is the atomic fraction of the i
th element and ri is the atomic 
radius. Fig.14(b) compares the values of Tc and δr of Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 with the respective values reported for other 
RMPEAs. It is observed that (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 has the highest Tc 
and δr values, consistent with its superior HT strength.
The impact of NbC on the HT properties is evaluated by analyzing the 
work-hardening rates and dislocation types at different compression 
temperatures. The work-hardening curves, classified into two types 
(Figs.15 (a1) and (a2)), reveal distinct behaviors based on the 
compression temperature. Below 1400 ◦C, the work hardening curves of 
Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibit high work-hardening 
rates, indicating strong HT softening resistance. Above 1400 ◦C, the 
work hardening behavior shows a significant transformation, with a 
sharp decrease in hardening rate with true strain in stage I (εT <10 %), 
indicating that dislocation slip occurs readily at this temperature. Be￾sides, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibits a lower slope in the work￾hardening curve (KWH) than Nb15Ta10W75, indicating stronger resis￾tance to HT deformation. The difference in work-hardening ability is 
closely related to temperature and micro-deformation mechanisms. To 
this end, the phase type and ρ of compressed samples subjected to εT =10 
% at 1400 and 1600 ◦C are evaluated using XRD, as shown in Fig. 15(b). 
NbC nano-precipitates still exist in (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 after under￾going HT compression with εT =10 %, which is beneficial for HT 
strength. The value of ρ, estimated using the Scherrer formula, in 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 is higher than that in Nb15Ta10W75 after HT

compression (Table 4), which benefits the HT strength [76].
Furthermore, the type of dislocation dominating the deformation 
plays a critical role in determining the HT strength [75]. The maximum 
Tc of both Nb15Ta10W75 and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 is about 1500 ◦C. 
Thus, the compression temperature of 1600 ◦C marks the transition 
between dislocation types. At temperatures below Tc, work-hardening 
curves dominated by the screw dislocations show continuous deforma￾tion behavior, while deformation dominated by the edge dislocations at 
temperatures above Tc results in a rapid decrease in the hardening rate 
[77]. The observed hardening curve conforms to such a change in the 
pattern, supporting the hypothesis that the HT strength transitions from 
screw-dominated to edge-dominated dislocation motion. To further 
clarify the types of dislocations operating at different temperatures, 
two-beam BF TEM images are obtained from compressed samples sub￾jected to εT =10 % at 1400 and 1600 ◦C. Results are shown in Figs.15
(c1-c4). The g vector is marked in each image, and its direction is denoted 
by a white arrow. b is determined using the g × b = 0 condition; detailed 
information is provided in Supplementary-Note 5 of supplementary 
material. (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 shows more dislocation lines than 
Nb15Ta10W75, consistent with the higher ρ results obtained using XRD. 
The dislocations are colored according to their respective orientation 
relationships with b. It is found that there are two kinds of dislocations 
based on their orientation relationship with different b: ± 1/2[11–1] in 
red, and ± 1/2[001], ± 1/2[111], ± 1/2[1–11] in orange. It is observed 
that only the edge dislocations exist in the Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 samples compressed to εT of 10 % at 1400 ◦C. In 
contrast, both screw and edge dislocations coexist in the samples that 
were compression tested at 1600 ◦C (εT =10 %). The accumulation of 
dislocations at the GBs, which is also observed, increases the back stress 
that could hinder dislocation glide. The average dislocation velocity (νd) 
is estimated using the Orowan equation [78,79]: 
vd = εv
ρb (28) 
εv = εL
H (29) 
where ρ is obtained from the XRD results (see Table 4), εv is the strain 
rate, H is the height of the HT compressed sample, εL is a constant 
loading rate of HT compression. At temperatures below Tc, only pure 
edge dislocations survived in the compressed samples Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. This is because of the difficulty of screw dislo￾cation cores dissociating into nonplanar structures during motion, while 
edge dislocations tend to divide into segments that slip more easily along 
the glide planes [72]. Therefore, screw dislocations are more prone to 
annihilation than edge dislocations, leading to the survival of pure edge 
dislocations and dominating the slip rate and HT strength. The estimated 
velocity of screw dislocations (vds) in Nb15Ta10W75 and 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 compressed at 1400 ◦C are 1.51 and 1.30 mm/s, 
respectively. When the temperature exceeds Tc, numerous Frank-Read 
sources are activated for dislocation multiplication, promoting the 
glide of the screw dislocations, whereas edge dislocations are less 
influenced. With deformation, the speed of screw dislocations becomes 
comparable to those of edge dislocations (vde), consequently maintain￾ing the HT strength. The screw and edge dislocations in Nb15Ta10W75 
and (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 at 1600 ◦C have similar mobilities, with vds =
vde= 2.36 mm/s for Nb15Ta10W75 and vds = vde = 2.21 mm/s for 
(Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5. The HT strength of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 in￾creases by about 111 MPa at 1400 ◦C and 110 MPa at 1600 ◦C compared 
to Nb15Ta10W75, attributed to the impediment of screw/edge dislocation 
movement by the NbC particles. Based on these results, it can be 
concluded that the NbC nano-precipitates can stably survive at HT and

5. Summary and conclusions
A design strategy for composite RMPEAs, suitable for LPBF via 
ceramic powder addition and in-situ nano-precipitate formation, was 
developed to simultaneously enhance printability, reduce anisotropy, 
and sustain strength at HT conditions. The main conclusions of this 
study are the following. 
1) By estimating the solid solubility and critical re-precipitation 
amounts of the in-situ nano-precipitates, and measuring the pow￾der flowability and laser absorptivity, we found that adding 1.5 at. % 
WC powder to matrix powders promotes the formation of in-situ 
phase and improves the print quality.
2) Incorporating 1.5 at. % WC powder also enhanced the laser ab￾sorptivity from 71 % to 86 % without compromising powder flow￾ability, expanding printing ranges of about 50 Jmm-3, reducing LOF 
pores, and improves the printed part density from 99.2 ± 0.15 % to 
99.5 ± 0.1 %.
3) During LPBF, the added WC powder particles dissolve in the melt 
pool and the C combines with Nb to form NbC in-situ. These pre￾cipitates, subsequently, act as heterogeneous nucleates to shorten 
solidification distance and inhibit columnar grain growth. As a 
result, a substantial reduction in microstructural and mechanical 
anisotropy is obtained. Moreover, (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 exhibits a 
superior yield strength at RT, which is attributed to the grain 
boundary, dislocation, and precipitation strengthening mechanisms. 
The HT strength of (Nb15Ta10W75)98.5C1.5 also increased due to the 
suppression of dislocation mobility by the NbC nano-precipitates.
