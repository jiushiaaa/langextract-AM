Modern engineering has long been in demand for high-performance additive manufactured materials
for harsh working conditions. The idea of high entropy alloy (HEA), medium entropy alloy (MEA), and
multi-principal-element alloy (MPEA) provides a new way for alloy design. In this work, we develop a
Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 quinary MEA which exhibits a superiority of mechanical properties over a wide tem￾perature ranging from 77 to 873 K via selective laser melting (SLM) and post-heat treatment. The present
MEA achieves an excellent ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1586 MPa with a total elongation (TE) of
22.7 % at 298 K, a UTS of 1944 MPa with a TE of 22.6 % at 77 K, and a UTS of 1147 MPa with a TE of
9.1 % at 873 K. The excellent mechanical properties stem from the microstructures composed of partially
refined grains and heterogeneously precipitated L12 phase due to the concurrence of recrystallization
and precipitation. The grain boundary hardening, precipitation hardening, and dislocation hardening con￾tribute to the high YS at 298 and 77 K. Interactions of nano-spaced stacking faults (SFs) including SFs
networks, Lomer–Cottrell locks (L–C locks), and anti-phase boundaries (APBs) induced by the shearing of
L12 phase are responsible for the high strain hardening rate and plasticity at 77 K. Our work provides
a new insight for the incorporation of precipitation hardening and additive manufacturing technology,
paving the avenue for the development of high-performance structural materials.

1. Introduction
High-performance alloys with gigapascal strength and good
ductility are highly desired for modern engineering applications.
The idea of high entropy alloy (HEA), medium entropy alloy (MEA),
and multi-principal element alloy (MPEA) provides a new avenue
for the further extension of the up-limit of strength-ductility com￾bination in the face-centered cubic (FCC) metal materials [1,2]. The
high work-hardening capability but relatively low strength of the
face-centered-cubic (FCC) MPEAs [2], which are mainly composed
of Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, and Mn, makes it a quite hot topic to strengthen
them. As an effective and widely used strengthening method, pre￾cipitation hardening has also been adopted into the FCC MPEAs,

among which the L12 phase strengthened MPEAs exhibit superior
mechanical properties [3–9]. The coherent interface between the
L12 phase and the FCC matrix could effectively reduce the stress
concentration and avoid the premature failure of the alloy [10–
12]. The L12 precipitates introduced via the co-doping of Ti and Al
exhibit lower environmental embrittlement, which achieves a less
loss of ductility in the intermetallic phase strengthened alloys [4].
Moreover, the small interfacial energy of the L12/FCC interface and
the slower diffusion effect of HEA contribute to the thermal sta￾bility of the L12 phase [13], and the L12 solvus temperature can
be raised to 1150 °C with appropriate alloying optimization [14],
making the L12 phase a promising strengthening phase at elevated
temperatures.
The equiatomic CoCrNi system exhibits excellent work￾hardening ability, and a more prominent combination of strength
and ductility compared with other CoCrFeMnNi HEAs at room
temperature and especially the cryogenic temperature [2,15],

making the CoCrNi MEA an ideal FCC matrix for the precipitation
strengthening. The exceptional mechanical properties of CoCrNi
MEA are attributed to twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) and
transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), which are widely ad￾mitted to be closely related to stacking fault energy (SFE) [16].
In recent years, studies about the non-equiatomic CoCrNi MEAs
reveal that tuning the content of Co can regulate the SFE of
the alloy and achieve higher work-hardening ability, making the
further optimization of mechanical properties of CoCrNi MEAs a
promising project [16,17]. For Ti/Al containing CoCrNi-based MEAs,
a lower content of Cr is also reported to be effective in reducing
the formation of the detrimental σ phase, indicating the compo￾sition design is of substantial importance in the optimization of
precipitation-strengthened CoCrNi-based MEAs [6].
However, the fabrication of casting alloys mentioned above
mostly involves multiple passes of mechanical treatments and heat
treatments to attain a tailored microstructure, making the produc￾tion routes laborious work, especially for the complex geometries.
Compared with the conventional fabrication routes, additive man￾ufacturing (AM) exhibits several superiorities, such as a high de￾gree of geometrical freedom in the design and production of metal
components with complex structures, a substantial reduction in
the loss of raw materials during post-processing compared to the
conventional fabrication method, and the consequent time, energy,
and cost-saving [18–21]. Moreover, the high energy input and high
cooling rate of AM methods can suppress phase transition and in￾termetallic formation, and also lead to a fine microstructure, mak￾ing it a potential fabrication route for MPEAs.
As one of the most prominent AM techniques, selective laser
melting (SLM) is widely applied to research about HEAs. The
research about the selective laser melted (SLMed) equiatomic
FeCoCrNiMn-based HEAs indicated that the fine grain structures,
cellular structures, and dislocations brought by SLM methods do
favor the improvement on the strength of HEAs compared to the
counterparts produced by casting [22–24]. The high cooling rate of
SLM also facilitates the formation of the single FCC structure and
the introduction of solid solution hardening brought by the sub￾stitutional and interstitial solute atoms. Park et al. [25] reported
a simultaneous improvement in the strength and ductility of Fe￾CoCrNiMn SLMed HEA by introducing 1 % C. Fujieda et al. [26] at￾tributed the decent synergy of strength-ductility (tensile strength
of 1178.0 MPa and elongation of 25.8 %) and the improved cor￾rosion resistance of the Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5Mo0.1 alloy to fine grain
structures and the absence of Ni3Ti intermetallic compounds. In
addition to the solid solution hardening effect, introducing inter￾stitial atoms, such as nitrogen, can lead to further strain hardening
mechanisms in SLMed HEAs. Song et al. [27] reported that the ni￾trogen doping induced a local grain refinement in the re-melted
regions during SLM, and the subsequent heterogeneous deforma￾tion induced hardening. For the eutectic HEA, the lamellar eutec￾tic structure can be refined via the application of SLM. Yang et al.
[28] reported a SLMed Ni30Co30Cr10Fe10Al18W1Mo1 (at.%) with an
ultra-fine lamellar spacing of 150–200 nm within the small colony
with the size of 2–6 μm, exhibiting a yield strength of 1.0 Gpa,
ultimate tensile strength of 1.4 GPa, and uniform elongation larger
than 18 %. Introducing nano secondary particles is also feasible in
SLMed HEAs. Lu et al. [29] produced a FeCoCrNiMn-TiC HEA com￾posite via SLM, which exhibits both an increase in strength and
ductility compared to the FeCoCrNiMn HEA.
Moreover, with a tailored composition and post-heat treat￾ments, nano precipitates, such as the L12 phase mentioned above,
can also be introduced into the SLMed HEAs, leading to a further
improvement in the mechanical properties with the combination
of precipitation hardening and advantages of the SLM method. The
(CoCrNi)94Ti3Al3 alloy reported by Yao et al. [30] benefits from
the low stacking faults energy (SFE) of the matrix, the hierarchical
microstructure composed of precipitation and heterogeneous grain
structure, and the inherent high density of dislocations, exhibit￾ing superior mechanical properties at cryogenic and ambient tem￾perature. The SLMed (FeCoNi)86Ti7Al7 alloy reported by Mu et al.
[31] exhibits a unique dislocation-precipitate skeleton (DPS), ultra￾high ultimate tensile strength of ∼1.8 GPa, and maximum elonga￾tion of ∼16 % at the ambient temperature. However, it meets a bot￾tleneck to raise the volume fraction of L12 precipitates with the
equiatomic CoCrNi matrix, since higher Ti/Al contents bring about
the precipitation of σ phase that deteriorates mechanical proper￾ties [32–34]. The equiatomic FeCoNi matrix shows a large solid
solubility of Al and Ti, but the inevitable L21 phase (Ni2TiAl) is
harmful to the mechanical performance at elevated temperatures
[31,35,36]. Hence, increasing the volume fraction of L12 precipi￾tates and avoiding the formation of detrimental phases are striv￾ing goals for the alloy design of L12-strengthened AMed MPEAs.
Meanwhile, modern engineering has put forward more urgent re￾quests for structural materials with excellent mechanical proper￾ties at harsh working conditions [21], such as at cryogenic or ele￾vated temperatures, making the development of high-performance
AMed alloys a challenging but promising subject.
In this study, a non-equiatomic Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 quinary MEA
was developed via SLM plus the post-heat treatment, exhibiting
superior mechanical properties over a wide temperature range
(from 77 to 873 K). A high volume fraction of heterogeneously pre￾cipitated L12 precipitates and the partially recrystallized FCC ma￾trix were introduced into the MEA simultaneously without other
harmful phases. The strengthening and deformation mechanisms
were investigated and discussed based on the microstructural ob￾servation. Our work provides insights into the development of
AMed L12 strengthened alloys, and also indicates that, with the
combination of proper elemental designs and heat treatments, ad￾ditive manufacturing could be a promising processing technique
for high-performance structural materials.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Alloy design
The nominal composition of the alloy and heat treatment pro￾cesses were designed according to previous studies and experi￾ments. Firstly, higher contents of Ni (30 at.%), Ti (4 at.%), and Al
(4 at.%) were chosen for introducing a high volume fraction of
the L12 phase with high anti-phase boundary (APB) energy [37].
Although even higher contents of Ti and Al were verified to be
practical and effective in strengthening the alloy, it is possible to
bring about the B2 phase and L21 phase [35,38]. Relatively lower
Cr was preferred to avoid the introduction of the σ phase [33,34].
High content of Co was preferred to lower the SFE, which may en￾dow the alloy with better sustainability of a high strain-hardening
rate at higher strain conditions [39,40]. The pseudo-binary equi￾librium phase diagram with varying Cr content was calculated by
the Thermo-Calc software (TCHEA5 database), as shown in Fig. S1
in Supplementary Information. Fig. S1 indicates that 42 at.% of Co
and 20 at.% of Cr can effectively avoid the possible detrimental σ
phase. Therefore, the composition of the alloy was determined to
be Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 (at.%).
The configuration entropy of the Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 (at.%) al￾loy was calculated to be 1.3R (The calculation method is shown in
Section 2 in Supplementary Information). It meets the definition
of MEAs [41]: 1.0R ≤  Sconf ≤ 1.5R, when the alloy is in a random
solution state. Therefore, the Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 (at.%) alloy is re￾ferred to as an MEA.
The suitable parameters for the heat treatments were chosen
via the combination of annealing trials, hardness tests, and mi￾crostructural characterizations. All the trials were attempted in

SLMed samples. The results indicated that annealing at 973 K for
64 h was the optimum heat treatment condition.
2.2. Materials fabrication
Pre-alloyed Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 (at.%) powders were produced
by gas atomization, exhibiting spherical shape and FCC structure
as shown in Fig. 1(a). The particle size ranged from 8 to 60 μm
with an average diameter of 22.9 μm (Fig. 1(b)). The SLM pro￾cess was conducted on a sandblasted stainless-steel substrate using
a commercial machine (FS121M-B5, Farsoon, China), with a laser
power of 200 W, scanning speed of 1000 mm s–1, hatching space
of 90 μm, beam size of 40 μm and the layer thickness of 40 μm.
Argon atmosphere was used to prevent oxidation during SLM. The
laser was rotated 67° in each scanning layer as shown in Fig. 1(c).
The geometry of the as-built material block was in a cuboid shape,
with a length of 65 mm, width of 18 mm, and height of 10 mm.
The as-built material blocks together with the substrate were an￾nealed at 723 K for 3 h followed by water quenching to release the
residual stress. After the residual stress relief heat treatment, the
as-built blocks were removed from the substrate by wire-electrode
cutting, then annealed at 973 K for 64 h followed by water quench￾ing. The as-built blocks that went through the residual stress relief
heat treatment are referred to as the as-built alloy, and the blocks
that went through two passes of heat treatments are referred to as
the as-annealed alloy.
2.3. Mechanical testing
The specimens for tensile tests were prepared via slicing the
as-built blocks by wire-electrode cutting. The uniaxial tensile tests
at room temperature (298 K) were conducted on the Instron 3369
machine equipped with an extensometer, using flat dog-bone￾shaped specimens with a gage length of 20 mm, and width of
4 mm. The uniaxial tensile tests at 77 K were conducted on an
MTS Alliance RT 30 tensile machine, using flat dog-bone-shaped
specimens with a gage length of 12.5 mm, and width of 3 mm. The
uniaxial tensile tests at 773 and 873 K were conducted on an RRC-
50 testing machine, using flat dog-bone-shaped specimens with a
gage length of 8 mm, and a width of 3.4 mm. Each sample has
a thickness of ∼1.5 mm after polishing. A strain rate of 1 × 10–3
s–1 was applied to all the tensile tests. Each test condition was re￾peated at least three times to ensure the reproducibility. In partic￾ular, before starting a tensile test at 77 K, the specimen was held
at 77 K for 5 min. Before starting a tensile test at 773 and 873 K,
the specimen was held at the testing temperature for 10 min.

2.4. Microstructural characterization
The particle size distribution of the pre-alloyed powders was
estimated by using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer
(Malvern, Micro-plus). The porosity of the as-built alloy was mea￾sured by the metallographic methods. The densities of the as-built
alloy and the casting alloy with the same composition were mea￾sured by the Archimedes method. Each density data was mea￾sured three times to ensure accuracy. The crystal structure and
phase composition of pre-alloyed powders, the as-built alloy, and
the as-annealed alloy were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD,
Rigaku D/MAX-2250, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The bulk sam￾ples for XRD characterization were polished using standard me￾chanical polishing procedures. The scanning step for all the XRD
measurements is 0.02°. The scanning in the 2θ range of 20°–100°
was conducted with a scanning speed of 5° min–1. A slow scan
in the 2θ range of 20°–37° was conducted with a scanning speed
of 0.5° min–1. The micromorphology of pre-alloyed powders, the
overview of the microstructures, and fracture surfaces were con￾ducted on the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA4
LMH) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Ul￾tim Max 40) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector.
The specimen sheets for SEM and EBSD analysis were firstly me￾chanically ground to 3000-grit SiC paper, followed by mechanical
polishing by colloidal silica suspension, and finally electrochemi￾cally polished by 10 % HClO4 + 90 % C2H5OH solution at 233 K
and 25 V. The EBSD data were analyzed by the Aztec Crystal
software. TEM characterizations were performed by transmission
electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, and JEM-ARM300F2,
Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) images were
taken using an annular-type detector with a collection angle rang￾ing from 92 to 228 mrad. The corresponding EDS mapping was
collected and processed by the auto filter in the Oxford INCA soft￾ware. TEM samples were sliced by wire-electrode cutting, and then
mechanically ground to about 50 μm by SiC paper, and finally
twin-jet electro-polished in 10 % HClO4 + 90 % C2H5OH solution
at 243 K and 25 V.
3. Results
3.1. As-built and as-annealed microstructures
The porosity value of the as-built alloy was measured to be
0.048 % via metallographic methods. The porosity value is the av￾erage value of the area ratios of porosities in the metallographs
shown in Fig. S2. The areas were measured by Image J. The den￾sity of the as-built alloy is 8.07 ± 0.02 g mm–3, and the density
of the corresponding casting alloy is 8.13 ± 0.02 g mm–3. There￾fore, the relative density is calculated to be 99.26 %, indicating
that the as-built alloy is nearly fully dense. The XRD patterns in
Fig. 1(d) indicate that the FCC phase is present in the as-built and
as-annealed alloys, while the L12 precipitate phase is introduced
during the annealing process. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the
grain structures before and after the annealing. The as-built alloy
exhibits clear melting tracks (Fig. 2(a)) and typical columnar grains
(Fig. 2(b)). After annealing, a large number of fine grains emerge
as shown in Fig. 2(c, d), indicating that recrystallization happens.
Given the morphology of grains in the as-annealed alloy, the re￾crystallization has only partially proceeded [42,43]. The decreasing
grain reference orientation deviation (GROD) in the as-annealed al￾loy, which is shown by the comparison between Fig. 2(e, f) and
Fig. 2(g, h), confirms the occurrence of recrystallization. Corre￾spondingly, the newly formed fine recrystallized grains lead to a
decreasing average grain size and a decrease in the density of
geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) which is reflected by
the decreasing values of Kernel average misorientation (KAM). The
corresponding KAM distribution maps and grain size distribution
maps are shown in Fig. S3.
Fig. 3 illustrates the detailed microstructures of the alloy be￾fore and after the annealing treatment. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the
grains in the as-built alloy are composed of uniform sub-grain cel￾lular structures, and no precipitates occur. The cellular structures
are columnar structures that are displayed cross-sectionally.
After the annealing, the cellular structures become coarsened.
The average diameter of cellular structures in the as-built alloy
and the as-annealed alloy is measured to be 0.63 and 1.24 μm,
respectively. The non-uniform growth of discontinuous precipita￾tion (DP) colonies is prevalently around grain boundaries, which
is indicated by arrows in Fig. 3(b). Discontinuous precipitates ex￾hibit typical lamellar or short-rod shape. At higher magnifica￾tion, it can be observed that the DP not only happens at re￾gions near grain boundaries but can also proceed deeply into the
grains as presented in Fig. 3(c). Discontinuous precipitates dis￾tributed more inside the grain exhibit finer and shorter rod shapes,
some even near-spherical. Moreover, DP is also evidently observed
in the newly formed fine recrystallized grains where the cellu￾lar structures vanish (Fig. 3(d)) and some annealing twins form
(Fig. 3(e)). However, no visible precipitate is observed in the re￾gions typically shown in Fig. 3(f) where cellular structures are
undamaged.
To further investigate the microstructures, TEM characterization
was conducted. Fig. 4(a) shows the distinct cellular structures with
sizes around 0.5–1 μm in the as-built alloy. The inserted selected￾area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicates that the as-built
alloy has a single FCC structure. The two-beam bright-field (BF)
image (Fig. 4(b)) and low-angle annular dark-field (LAADF) scan￾ning transmission microscopy (STEM) image (Fig. 4(c)) reveal that
the cellular boundaries are composed of dislocation walls. In ad￾dition to the dislocation walls, there are also many dislocations
inside the cellular structures. The corresponding STEM energy￾dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results show the Ti segregation
on the cellular boundaries.
The TEM BF image (Fig. 5(a)) and the corresponding dark-field
(DF) image (Fig. 5(b)) distinctly show the strip-like morphology
of discontinuous precipitates. The inserted SAED pattern confirms
that the matrix has FCC structure and the discontinuous precip￾itates have the L12 structure. The two-beam BF image (Fig. 5(c))
shows a relatively larger view of the DP region. The tangled dis￾locations that make up the cell boundaries are mostly annihilated,
and only some traces of remaining dislocations walls can still be
identified as referred to by arrows in Fig. 5(c). The high-angle an￾nular dark-field (HAADF) image (Fig. 5(d)) also shows that the orig￾inal cellular boundaries composed of tangled dislocations are elim￾inated, but the distribution of precipitates in the DP region exhibits
a cellular contour. The corresponding STEM-EDS results (Fig. 5(e))
show obvious segregation of Ni, Ti, and Al along cellular contours.
Fig. 6 gives the HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDS
mapping of discontinuous L12 precipitates with higher magnifica￾tion. The concentration of Ni, Ti, and Al inside the cellular con￾tour exhibits a stripe-like shape, which corresponds to the mor￾phology of discontinuous L12 precipitates. Meanwhile, the HAADF￾STEM image shows that there are more L12 precipitates along the
cellular contour, indicating that more L12 precipitates form along
the original cellular boundaries where there was a segregation of
Ti, and they subsequently make up of the cellular contour with no
dislocations. But in the areas near grain boundaries, where discon￾tinuous precipitates show larger sizes, cellular contours with en￾richment of Ni, Ti, and Al are eliminated as shown in Fig. S4.
In addition to the DP region with annihilated dislocation walls,
the undamaged cellular structures can be observed in the as￾annealed alloy as Fig. 7(a) shows. The inserted SAED pattern

(Fig. 7(a)) and the DF image (Fig. 7(b)), which corresponds to the
area labelled with the red dash-lined rectangle in Fig. 7(a), in￾dicate the continuous precipitation (CP) of L12 precipitates. The
continuous L12 precipitates are spherical, and much smaller than
the discontinuous L12 precipitates so they can only be character￾ized via TEM. Hence, there is no visible precipitate in Fig. 3(f).
The LAADF-STEM image of the CP region (Fig. 7(c)) shows that
cellular boundaries composed of dislocation walls are still main￾tained after the CP happens. The corresponding STEM-EDS results
(Fig. 7(d)) also shows an obvious enrichment of Ni, Ti, and Al along
cell boundaries. The LAADF-STEM image with higher magnification
of the region inside the cellular structure, where marked with a
dash-lined square in Fig. 7(c), and its corresponding STEM-EDS re￾sults (Fig. 7(e)) confirm the presence of continuous L12 precipi￾tates inside the cellular structure. The enlarged view of the disloca￾tion wall, where marked with a dash-lined circle in Fig. 7(c), and
the corresponding STEM-EDS results (Fig. 7(f)) confirm that there
are also L12 precipitates within the dislocation wall. Compared

with the intra-cellular precipitates, the inter-cellular precipitates
exhibit a more ellipsoidal shape. Similar dislocation-precipitation
skeletons were also observed in the AMed Fe28Co29.5Ni27.5Ti8.5Al6.5
alloy [31], and the morphology difference between intra-cellular
precipitates and the inter-cellular precipitates was ascribed to the
pipe-diffusion mechanism and the elemental dragging effect. The
atomic-scale high-resolution (HR) TEM observation in Fig. 8 shows
that both the discontinuous precipitates and continuous precipi￾tates are fully coherent with the FCC matrix. The corresponding
fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns further confirm the L12 struc￾ture of precipitates.
3.2. Mechanical properties at different temperatures
The representative engineering stress-strain curves of the as￾built alloy tested at 298 and 77 K, and the as-annealed alloy at
298, 77, 773, and 873 K are presented in Fig. 9(a). The values of
yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and total elon￾gation (TE) are listed in Table 1. Compared to the results at 298 K,
the as-built alloy shows an increase in both strength and ductility
at 77 K.
After annealing, the alloy at 298 K exhibits a great improve￾ment for the YS (734 ± 9 to 1180 ± 10 MPa) and UTS (995 ± 7
to 1586 ± 11 MPa) and still maintains excellent ductility (22.7 %
± 0.3 %). When the testing temperature decreases to 77 K, the
YS and UTS increase to 1341 ± 17 and 1944 ± 6 MPa, respec￾tively. Meanwhile, the ductility is unaffected. At elevated tempera￾Table 1

The true stress-true strain curves and the corresponding strain￾hardening rate curves of the as-built alloys and as-annealed al￾loys tested at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 9(b). For
the same alloy, the strain-hardening rate at 77 K is the highest,
showing an apparent temperature dependence. Meanwhile, com￾pared to the as-built alloy, the as-annealed alloy shows a distinctly
higher strain-hardening rate at the same temperature. Fig. 9(c–f)

at 77 K. The comparison of yield strengths and total elongations
shows a similar trend in Fig. S5(a). For mechanical properties at

a wide range of temperatures from 77 to 873 K, especially the
prominent mechanical properties at 77 K.

3.3. Deformation substructures
To understand the deformation mechanism underlying the ex￾cellent mechanical properties of the as-annealed alloy, TEM obser￾vations on the deformed microstructure of the as-built alloy and
the as-annealed alloy were conducted.
The microstructure of the as-built alloy after the deformation
at 298 and 77 K is shown in Fig. 10. Compared with the mi￾crostructure before the deformation shown in Fig. 4(a, b), the den￾sity of dislocations inside cellular structures distinctly increases as
Fig. 10(a) shows, suggesting a massive dislocation multiplication
during the plastic deformation. The thickened cell boundaries in￾dicate that more dislocations tangled here after the deformation,
which suggests that the cell boundaries play a critical role in im￾peding the motion of dislocations. Similar microstructures that can
hinder the movement of dislocations always play a positive ef￾fect on the strength, such as grain boundaries and interfaces be￾tween phases [53]. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the planar disloca￾tion configuration is composed of slip bands along {111} planes
while no deformation twin (DT) and stacking faults (SFs) are ob￾served in the as-built alloy deformed at 298 K, indicating that pla￾nar dislocation glide is the main deformation mechanism. While

L–C lock generated by two intersected SFs.
at 77 K, a large number of SFs and DTs are observed in the as￾built alloy after deformation, as illustrated in Fig. 10(c, d). A sim￾ilar phenomenon has been observed in the other CoCrNi-based
MPEA [30,54–56]. The activation of SFs and DTs could effectively
relieve the stress concentration, and the newly formed SFs and
DTs could further impede the motion of dislocations, thus both
the ductility and strength of the as-built alloy are improved at
77 K. The tendency of activating SFs and DTs at cryogenic tem￾peratures is ascribed to the SFE which decreases with decreasing
temperature.
Fig. 11 shows the microstructure of the as-annealed alloy after
deformation at 298 and 77 K. Generally, planar dislocation glide
is the main deformation mechanism. At 298 K, SFs can be acti￾vated in two {111} planes in the CP regions, intersecting with each
other severely, as the arrows indicated in Fig. 11(a). But in DP re￾gions, more SFs extend in one direction (Fig. 11(b)). A similar phe￾nomenon has been reported by Zhao et al. [54], and it is ascribed
to the difference in precipitate morphology between CP and DP re￾gions. At 77 K, a high density of intersecting slip bands shown in
Fig. 11(c) indicates the severe deformation dominated by the pla￾nar glide at the CP region. Fig. 11(d) presents the L12 precipitate
sheared by SF, forming an APB. While at the DP region, SFs are also
activated in two {111} planes, and the intersection between SFs is
significantly enhanced, forming SF networks as shown in Fig. 11(e).
Furthermore, the mutual interaction between the SFs leads to the
formation of sessile dislocations, which are generally called Lomer–
Cottrell locks (L–C locks) [57] as Fig. 11(f) shows.
Fig. 12 shows the microstructures of the as-annealed alloy after
tensile tests at elevated temperatures of 773 and 873 K. Generally,
the density of SFs decreases while tested at 773 K. Scattered and
short SFs can be observed in the CP region as Fig. 12(a) shows. The
number of intersecting SFs also decreases, but they can still be ob￾served in a few DP regions (Fig. 12(b)). As for the alloy tested at
873 K, no intersecting SFs is observed, and the density of SFs fur￾ther decreases in both the CP and DP regions, as shown in Fig. 12(c,
d).
4. Discussion
4.1. The formation of the heterogeneous microstructure
As the microstructure characterization presented in Section 3.1,
the as-annealed alloy exhibits a heterogeneous microstructure
composed of a partially recrystallized matrix and the heteroge￾neously precipitated L12 phase, which can also be categorized into
CP regions and DP regions. The formation mechanism of both re￾gions during the annealing is discussed below.
The DP behavior is closely related to the migration of reac￾tion fronts (RFs). The residual strain in the as-built alloy provides
a sufficient driving force for the activation of the recrystallization
[43], thus promoting the bulging and migration of grain bound￾aries (GBs), making them ideal RFs. Comparing Fig. 2(a, c), many
newly formed fine grains are distributed around the melting track
regions, indicating that recrystallization is inclined to begin around
256

boundaries. Except for those high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs),
there are also many low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and cellu￾lar boundaries in the intra-granular region. There are three general
recrystallization nucleation mechanisms: strain-induced boundary
migration (SIBM), sub-grain coarsening, and sub-grain coalescence
[58]. The SIBM originates from HAGBs, while sub-grain coarsen￾ing and sub-grain coalescence are involved with the production of
HAGBs starting from LAGBs. However, the production of HAGBs by
the movement of sub-grain boundaries needs enough orientation
gradient [59]. Fig. 13(a, b) shows an area from the XY plane of the
as-built alloy where KAMs are distinct enough to show the con￾tours of cellular boundaries. The point-to-point (Fig. 13(c)) and cu￾mulative (Fig. 13(d)) changes of the orientation along the marked
line in Fig. 13(b) indicate that neither the orientation gradient be￾tween cells nor the long-range orientation gradient is substan￾tial. Therefore, it is reasonable that the recrystallization in the as￾annealed alloy mostly originates from the HAGBs, which is consis￾tent with the bulging of GBs in the as-annealed alloy (Fig. 13(e)).
During the DP process, the bulging GBs keep advancing into
the original grains, and dislocations composing cellular boundaries
are eliminated after GBs sweep over. The bulging GBs are also
short-circuit diffusion paths for solutes and preferable nucleation
257

sites for the L12 phase. Once the nucleation of the L12 phase hap￾pens on the migrating grain boundaries, the precipitates will pin
on the GBs. The boundary segments between the pinning precip￾itates keep bowing out due to the thermal activation. Meanwhile,
the precipitates keep growing on the original pinning spots with
the aid of rapid solute transporting from moving GBs, leading to
the lamellar or short-rod morphology [60,61]. At the initial stage,
the movement of bulging GBs is relatively fast, and the diffusion
of solutes is limited, so the size of discontinuous precipitates in
the intra-granular regions is smaller (about ∼20 nm). It should be
noted that the elemental segregation along cellular boundaries is
continuously promoted as the annealing process begins. The Ni, Ti,
and Al segregating along the original cellular boundaries may not
be completely consumed by the rapid DP. Therefore, more L12 pre￾cipitates form at the original cellular boundaries, though disloca￾tion walls have annihilated. When the recrystallization comes to
the late stage, the advance of GBs slows down, and there would be
more time for the diffusion and accumulation of solutes, so precip￾itates near GBs exhibit larger sizes, and no cellular contour com￾posed of precipitates can be observed (as shown in Fig. S4).
Meanwhile, without bulging GBs sweeping into the intra￾granular regions, the cellular structures made up of dislocations
are retained, and CP dominates in the non-recrystallized grains.
During the annealing process, the elemental segregation is con￾tinuously enhanced, so more L12 precipitates form along cellu￾lar boundaries, and L12 precipitates in the intra-cellular regions
slowly grow up to an average size of ∼10 nm. The evolution of
the microstructure during the annealing can be illustrated in the
schematic drawing in Fig. 14.
4.2. Strengthening mechanism
In our current works, grains exhibit heterogeneous grain sizes
resulting from partial recrystallization. Except for the grain sizes,
the sizes of L12 precipitates and dislocation densities differ in
grains in discontinuous precipitation (DP) regions and continuous
precipitation (CP) regions, making the discussion about whether
the as-annealed alloy is a heterostructured material necessary.
It is noteworthy that not all materials with heterogeneous mi￾crostructure can be regarded as heterostructured materials. Zhu
et al. [62] indicate that heterostructured materials consist of het￾erogeneous zones with dramatic (> 100 %) variations in mechani￾cal and/or physical properties and the interaction in these hetero￾zones produces a synergistic effect where the integrated property
exceeds the prediction by the rule-of-mixtures. To figure out the
difference in the strength of regions in the materials, nanoinden￾tation tests were conducted on the XY plane and XZ plane of the
as-annealed alloy. 100 points were measured on each sample. The
microstructure around each single nanoindentation was identified
via SEM, and microstructures were classified into three categories:
(1) Grains with continuous precipitates; (2) coarse recrystallized
grains with discontinuous precipitates; (3) fine recrystallized grains
with discontinuous precipitates, which are shown in Fig. S6. More
details about the three categories of microstructure are also pre￾sented in Section 7 in Supplementary Information. The average
Vicker hardness of these three kinds of microstructures on the XY
plane and XZ plane is quite close, as shown in Fig. S7, indicating
the as-annealed alloy in our work can be regarded as the conven￾tional alloy.
The contribution of cellular structures is another controversial
issue. The cellular structures are known to play a critical role in the
optimization of mechanical properties of FCC structure alloys fab￾ricated by selective laser melting. Earlier studies indicated that the
strengthening effect of the cellular structures is Hall–Petch type
[63]. However, it is found that the strength is independent of cell
size, and dislocation densities of the alloy have been identified
as the dominant factor in strengthening [64]. Some studies indi￾cated that the strengthening effect of cellular structures is some￾how conditional [65]. Cellular structures may be sufficiently strong
against dislocation penetration and hence, behave like HAGBs, re￾sulting in the Hall-Petch strengthening manner. Alternatively, they
can be weak and only act as dislocation bundles when interacting
258
J. Huang, W. Li, T. Yang et al. Journal of Materials Science & Technology 197 (2024) 247–264
with moving dislocations, resulting in a dislocation-like strength￾ening manner. As Fig. 10(b) shows, the cellular boundaries com￾posed of tangled dislocations may decompose at high strain, indi￾cating the cellular boundaries in the as-built alloy are not as strong
as grain boundaries. The KAM map of the as-built alloy shown in
Fig. 13(b) suggests that the cellular boundaries here can only cause
limited local misorientations, which cannot be even regarded as
LAGBs. Therefore, the contribution of cellular boundaries here is
attributed to the dislocation hardening.
Based on the microstructural characterization, the increase in
the yield strength of the as-annealed alloy can be ascribed to the
contribution of solid solution hardening (Δσss ), grain boundary
hardening (Δσ gb), dislocation hardening (Δσ dis ), and precipita￾tion hardening (Δσ ppt), in addition to the matrix friction stress
(σfr). Therefore, the yield strength of the as-built alloy and the
as-annealed alloy at 298 K can be demonstrated by the following
equation:
σy−as built=σfr + Δσss + Δσ gb + Δσ dis, (1)
σy-as annealed = σfr−matrix + Δσss + Δσ gb + Δσ dis + Δσ ppt, (2)
For the as-built alloy, the friction stress (σfr) is determined as
218 MPa by using the friction stress of the equiatomic CoCrNi alloy
[66]. For the as-annealed alloy,σfr-matrix should multiply the vol￾ume fraction of the FCC matrix phase (fmatrix).
σfr−matrix = σfr · fmatrix, (3)
fmatrix = 1 − fppt, (4)
fppt = PDP · fdp + PCP · fcp. (5)
where fppt is the volume fraction of precipitates. PDP is the volume
fraction of the discontinuous precipitation region to the whole ma￾trix, and PCP is the volume fraction of the continuous precipitation
region to the matrix. fdp is the volume fraction of discontinuous
precipitates in the discontinuous precipitation region, fcp is the vol￾ume fraction of continuous precipitates in the continuous precipi￾tation region.
PDP and PCP are estimated to be 77.6 % and 22.4 % via SEM fig￾ures, respectively. fdp is calculated to be 28.3 % by using the lever
rule. However, continuous precipitates are too small to attain re￾liable chemical composition via TEM. The previous study indicates
that the difference in volume fractions of L12 precipitates in differ￾ent regions of the heterogenous matrix is less than 2 % [6]. Hence,
the fcp is regarded to be equal to 28.3 %. It follows that fppt and
fmatrix are 28.3% and 71.7 %, respectively, thus σfr-matrix = 218 ×
71.7 % = 156.3 MPa.
The strengthening effect from solid-solution (Δσss ) can be cal￾culated by the standard model based on the interactions between
dislocations and the substitutional solute atoms [3]:
Δσss = M G · εs

where M is the Taylor factor, here M = 3.06 for FCC metals [3];
G is the shear modulus, here G = 88.7 GPa (borrowed from the
equiatomic CoCrNi MEA [67]); am is the lattice constant of the ma￾trix, here am = 0.357 nm (borrowed from the equiatomic CoCrNi
MEA [67]); c is the molar ratio of the solute atoms, here c should
be the total molar ratio of Ti and Al. Based on the STEM-EDS mea￾surement, on the as-built and as-annealed alloys, values of c are
7.49 % and 2.07 %, respectively. εs is the interaction factor. ɛG and
εa are interaction parameters that are related to elastic size mis￾match and atomic mismatch, respectively. Compared with εa, the
effect of ɛG is negligible, so the εs can be generally treated as 3εa,
Δσss can be approximately regarded to be proportional to c1/2.
The Δσss of the solid-solution-state (CoCrNi)94Al3Ti3 alloy was es￾timated to be ∼49 MPa [54]. Hence, the strengthening effect of
solid-solution (Δσss) for as-built and as-annealed alloys is calcu￾lated to be 61.2 and 16.9 MPa, respectively, indicating the solid￾solution hardening contribution is quite limited.
The strengthening contribution from grain boundaries (Δσ gb)
can be calculated by using the classical Hall–Petch formula:
Δσ gb = kgb · d−1/2 (9)
where kgb is the strengthening coefficient, and d is the average
grain size. kgb = 568 MPa μm−1/2 [54], and the average grain size
for the as-built and as-annealed alloy is 11.9 and 3.5 μm, respec￾tively. Thus, Δσ gb for the as-built and as-annealed alloys are cal￾culated to be 164.3 and 303.6 MPa, respectively.
The Δσ dis can be estimated by the following equation [68]:
Δσ dis = MαGbρ1/2
, (10)
ρGND = 2θ
ub . (11)
where α = 0.2 for FCC metals [69]; b is the Burgers vector
(b = 0.2532 × 10–9 m for the as-built alloy, and b = 0.2527 ×
10–9 m for the as-annealed alloy, which are calculated from the
XRD pattern). ρ represents the density of GNDs. θ is the KAM
value obtained from the KAM maps, here we use the average of
KAM values acquired from the XY plane and the XZ plane of the
as-built alloy and the as-annealed alloy (Fig. S3). θas−built = 0.45°,
θas−annealed = 0.395°. μ is the unit length for EBSD characteriza￾tion, here μ = 0.2 μm. Based on KAMs, the dislocation density is
calculated: ρas−built = 3.10 × 1014 m–2, and ρas−annealed = 2.73 ×
1014 m–2. Hence, Δσ dis for the as-built and as-annealed alloys are
calculated to be 242.0 and 225.4 MPa, respectively.
The Δσ ppt is given by the ordering strengthening [70]:
Δσ ppt = 0.81M γAPB

f
 1/2
(12)
where f is the volume fraction of precipitates, f = 28.3 %; γAPB is
the antiphase boundary energy, here γAPB = 143 mJ m–2 [6]. There￾fore, the  σppt at 298 K is calculated to be 404.8 MPa.
According to the investigation on the yield strength at different
temperatures, the friction stress of the matrix versus temperature
can be expressed as [2]:
σf(T ) = 2G
1 − ν exp −2πω0
b
 · exp −2πω0
bTm
T
 (13)
where ν is the Poisson’s ratio, ω0 is the dislocation width at 0 K,
b is the Burgers vector, T is the testing temperature, and Tm is the
melting temperature. Note that b is regarded as the temperature￾independent term since the change of b with temperature is very
small. However, GFCC and ν are temperature-dependent terms.
By using σfr (298 K) = 218 MPa, GFCC(298 K) = 88.7 GPa,
ν (298 K) = 0.314 [71], Tm = 1664 K [6], the ω0 is calculated to
be 0.958b. At 77 K, GFCC(77 K) = 93.5 GPa [67], ν(77 K) = 0.308
[71], thus the σfr values for the as-built and as-annealed alloy are
calculated to be 498.9 and 357.7 MPa, respectively.
Δσ gb and Δσ ppt are considered to be temperature￾independent for the as-built or the annealed specimens when
tested at 298 or 77 K, since the grain size and precipitate volume
fraction are postulated to be fixed at these two test temperatures.
For Δσss, if the change of εs with temperature is ignored, the

experimental values.

σss for as-built and as-annealed alloys are calculated to be 64.5
and 17.8 MPa, respectively. Δσ dis would also change with the
temperature due to the change of G. With the changed G, Δσ dis
at 77 K for the as-built and as-annealed alloy are calculated to be
255.1 and 237.6 MPa, respectively.
The contribution from all the strengthening effects mentioned
above is displayed in Fig. 15. The calculation results are well agreed
with the experimental results. Precipitation hardening makes the
most contribution for the as-annealed alloy at 298 and 77 K, and
grain boundary strengthening and dislocation strengthening result￾ing from additive manufacturing takes the second place, exhibiting
the excellent combination of precipitation hardening and the ad￾vantage of additive manufacturing.
4.3. Temperature-dependent strain-hardening rate
The strain-hardening rate of the as-built and the as-annealed
alloy show evident temperature dependence, as presented in
Fig. 9(b). For the as-built alloy, the planar dislocation glide is the
dominant deformation mode at 298 K. While at 77 K, a large num￾ber of SFs are generated via dislocation dissociation, and DTs are
also activated. SFs and DTs provide more resistance to the disloca￾tion slip by decreasing the mean free path of dislocations, which
is called the dynamic Hall–Petch effect [72–74] so that the as-built
alloy shows higher strain-hardening rate, strength, and ductility at
77 K.
For the as-annealed alloy, the planar dislocation glide acts as
the main deformation mechanism from 77 to 873 K, and no DT is
observed. The fully coherent interface between the high density of
L12 precipitates and the FCC matrix can relieve stress concentra￾tion [10], providing a higher strain-hardening rate and maintain￾ing a respectable uniform plastic deformation at the same time.
The increase in the number of SFs at 77 K leads to a decreasing
SF spacing size and more SF networks, which are confirmed to be
significantly effective in impeding the movement of dislocations
and retaining strain-hardening [74,75]. On the other hand, the L￾C lock generated by the interactions between SFs can further hin￾der the moving dislocations and provide more dislocations to ac￾commodate plastic deformation by serving as Frank-Read disloca￾tion sources [57]. Furthermore, the APBs formed by the interaction
between SFs and L12 precipitates can act as barriers against dis￾location mobility, which can further increase the strain-hardening
rate [76]. Hence, the as-annealed alloy shows the best synergy of
strength and ductility at 77 K, and a much higher strain-hardening
rate is obtained at 77 K in comparison with that at 298 K. When
the test temperature increases to 773 and 873 K, the strength of
the as-annealed alloy decreases together with the density of SFs.
Accordingly, the strain hardening rate of the as-annealed alloy
is SFs-mediated, which is closely associated with the SFE as the
following equation describes [77]:
τSF = 2γSF
bp
(14)
where γSF is the SFE, τSF is the critical resolved shear stress re￾quired for spontaneous partial dislocation separation and associ￾ated extended SF formation, and bp is the Burgers vector of a
Shockley partial dislocation. The stacking fault energy (γSF) of the
FCC matrix at 298 K can be estimated using the following equation
[78]:
γSF = nρAΔGFCC→HCP + 2σFCC/HCP (15)
where n is the number of fault layers, i.e., n = 2 for an intrin￾sic stacking fault, ρA is the molar surface density,  GFCC→HCP is
the difference in Gibbs free energy of FCC and HCP phases, and
σFCC/HCP is the interfacial energy between FCC and HCP phases,
which is assumably 10 ± 5 mJ m–2 for transition metals [79]. For
{111}, ρA is defined as:
ρA = 4

where aFCC is the lattice constant of the FCC phase, which is
0.3571 nm according to the deconvolution of the (311) XRD peak,
as shown in Fig. S8, and NA is the Avogadro constant. Therefore,
ρA is calculated to be 3 × 10–5 mol m–2. By performing chem￾ical composition-based thermodynamic calculation using Thermo￾Calc (TCHEA5 database), the left unknown parameter in Eq. (15),

where GFCC and GHCP are the total energies of FCC and HCP struc￾tures based on the composition of the FCC phase in the current
alloy, as listed in Table 2. By substituting Eqs. (16) and (17) as
well as other derived parameters into Eq. (15), γSF is estimated
as 25 ± 10 mJ m–2. At room temperature, this value may be too
high to activate twinning, but reasonably low enough to introduce
pronounced slip planarities such as SF networks and L–C locks in
the FCC phase [80], which can be further confirmed by calculat￾ing the critically resolved shear stress (τSF) to initiate SFs in the
matrix of the present alloy by Eq. (14). Here bp is the Burgers
vector of 1/6<112> partial dislocations (0.1458 nm). Thus, τSF is
computed to be 343 MPa, and the critical stress (σSF) is estimated
to be 1043 MPa by multiplication of Taylor factor (M = 3.06 [3]),
i.e., σSF = Mτ SF, which is well below the YS and flow stress of as￾annealed alloy (1180 MPa), resulting in observed SFs at room tem￾perature.
Additionally, the possibility of SFs penetrating through L12 pre￾cipitates in the as-annealed alloy at 298 K is theoretically evalu￾ated as follows. Consider that L12 can be shorn by dislocations, i.e.,
the flow stress is larger than the precipitate shearing stress (Δσ ppt

where γSISF is the SISF energy, bl is the Burgers vector of the lead￾ing 1/3<112> dislocation (0.2935 nm here), r is the dislocation
separation distance, Gs, as, and νs are shear modulus (89.2 GPa
[83]), lattice constant (0.3595 nm here), and Poison’s ratio (∼0.2
[84]) of the L12 phase, respectively. By taking the range of γSISF
(from ∼50 mJ m–2 for Ni-based to ∼100−150 mJ m–2 for Co-based
superalloys [85]) into account, the applied flow stress against r can
be plotted using σSISF = Mτ SISF, as shown in Fig. 16, which in￾dicates that the SFs can be activated in L12 precipitates at room
temperature.
It has been reported that the SFEs of FCC alloys and MPEAs in￾crease with increasing temperature. At 77 K, the SFE is lower than
that at room temperature. The lower the SFE, the lower the σSF,
so that more SFs are activated, forming SF networks and L–C locks
and leading to the ultra-high strain hardening rate. As tempera￾ture increases to 773 and 873 K, the SFE is higher than that at
Fig. 16. The estimated critical flow stress σSISF for the onset of SFs in the L12 phases
with different γSISF vs. the dislocation separation distance (r).
room temperature, thus the σSF also increases, leading to the de￾creasing numbers of SFs and strain-hardening rate. Therefore, the
as-annealed alloy exhibits a temperature-dependent strain harden￾ing rate, which stems from the variation of SFE with temperature
[86,87].
However, it should be pointed out that the variation of SFE
with temperature is not the only influence that decides the
temperature-dependent strain-hardening behavior of alloys. Pierce
et al. [88] reported that the increase in the SFE with the increas￾ing temperature (from RT to 400 °C) of the Fe-22/25/28Mn-3Al-
3Si (wt%) alloys causes the transition from planar to wavy dis￾location glide and the decrease in the work hardening rate from
0 to 0.1 true strain when the twinning has not been activated,
which is consistent with the as-annealed alloy here. However, for
the mechanical twinning, although the critical resolved shear stress

dence, the increase in SFE with temperature had a rather minor in-
fluence on the CRSS for twinning. The decrease in friction stress of
alloys with the elevated temperature is considered one of the rea￾sons for the late activation of twinning at elevated temperatures.
The reducing friction stress is revealed to facilitate the cross slip
[89], which in turn reduces the local stress concentrations and de￾lays the initiation of mechanical twinning to higher normal stress
levels.
It is worth mentioning that mechanical properties at elevated
temperatures may also be affected by dynamic recovery (DRV) and
dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Fig. 17 shows the deformed mi￾crostructure from the XZ plane of the as-annealed alloy tested at
773 K (Fig. 17(a, b)) and 873 K (Fig. 17(c, d)). The alloy tested at
773 K exhibits a higher density of GNDs, which is consistent with
its better ductility. Compared with the microstructure before defor￾mation, the average grain sizes show little change, and the GNDs
densities increase. The grain size distribution map and KAM dis￾tribution maps are shown in Fig. S10. Moreover, both of the ten￾sile curves tested at 773 and 873 K in Fig. 9 did not exhibit soft￾ening before the fracture, indicating no evident DRX happens till
the fracture. Although DRX contributes little to the decrease of the
strength, the climbing of dislocations would be enhanced at ele￾vated temperatures due to thermal activation, thus deteriorating
the effect of dislocation strengthening and leading to the decreas￾ing strength of the as-annealed alloy [23,59].
The fracture surface of the tensile alloys tested at 773 and
873 K exhibit mixed fracture mode (Fig. 18(a, e)). Dimples pre￾vail in a large area as Fig. 18(b, c, f, g) shows, which is consistent
with the decent ductility. However, there are also typical cleavage
facets with intergranular cracks around (Fig. 18(d, h)), indicating

that the coarse discontinuous precipitates along grain boundaries
are responsible for the decrease of elongation at elevated temper￾atures [36,90]. It is noteworthy that the considerable decrease of
elongation at intermediate temperatures commonly exists in poly￾crystalline alloys, such as Ni-based superalloys, which are referred
to as intermediate-temperature embrittlement [91]. Intergranular
precipitates, grain boundary shearing or sliding, gas phase em￾brittlement, decohesion of glide plane, dynamic strain aging, and
grain boundary segregation of impurities are the main existing in￾terpretations for the intermediate-temperature embrittlement. The
coarse discontinuous precipitates along grain boundaries should
not be the only reason for the intermediate-temperature embrittle￾ment of the as-annealed alloy, and the clarification of other mech￾anisms needs further studies in the future.
No DT has been found in the Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 MEAs after de￾formation, except for the as-built alloy deformed at 77 K, which is
different from some CoCrNi MEAs and CoCrNiTiAl MEAs that are
dominated by DT at room temperature [30,54–56]. The activation
of twinning is often thought to be relevant to the low SFE [55,92].
It has been revealed that the addition of Ti and Al can increase the
SFE of the alloy [93,94], making it more difficult to activate DTs at
room temperature for the as-built alloy which is in the solid so￾lution state. However, when it turns to the cryogenic temperature,
the SFE would decrease with the lower temperature as indicated
by previous studies [87,95], and more SFs contribute to higher flow
stress, making the activation of DT possible and finally leading to
significantly improved ductility.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that the twin initiation stress
can also be affected by the grain size [96]. The relationship can be
described by the following equation [97]:
σT = M γ
bp
+
k
√T
d (20)
where σT is the critical twinning stress, M is the Taylor factor, γ
is the SFE, bp is the Burgers vector of a partial dislocation, kT is
the Hall–Petch constant for twinning, and d is the grain size. Af￾ter the annealing, the average grain size decreases from 9.6 to
3.5 μm due to the recrystallization as shown in Fig. 2, thus the
inhibition of DTs is enhanced due to the increased critical shear
stress. Furthermore, the drastically reduced channel width of the
FCC matrix due to the high density of L12 precipitates makes
it even harder to activate DTs for the as-annealed alloy even at
cryogenic temperature, which is supported by other reported L12
precipitation-strengthened CoCrNi-based MEAs whose deformation
are mainly SFs mediated [30,54,74,98]. Moreover, the L12-type pre￾cipitates possess much higher SFE compared to the FCC matrix, so
that the incorporation of L12 precipitates would substantially in￾crease the global SFE of the alloy, and subsequently increase the
critical stress for twinning nucleation, leading to the suppression
of the DT initiation [74,99].
5. Conclusions
In the present work, we successfully developed a precipita￾tion hardening Co42Cr20Ni30Ti4Al4 MEA via SLM and the post-

heat treatment, exhibiting an excellent strength-ductility combi￾nation from 77 to 873 K. The strengthening mechanisms and the
temperature-dependent strain-hardening rate were explored and
discussed. The following conclusions can be drawn:
(1) The microstructures are composed of the partially recrystal￾lized matrix and heterogeneous precipitation of the L12 phase,
stemming from the concurrence of recrystallization and pre￾cipitation during the post-heat treatment. Discontinuous pre￾cipitation of the L12 phase takes place where recrystalliza￾tion occurs, and continuous precipitation takes place at non￾recrystallized regions. Cellular boundaries composed of disloca￾tions are preferable nucleation sites for the L12 phase but do
not act as nucleation sites for the recrystallization as high-angle
grain boundaries due to the limited misorientations.
(2) The as-annealed MEA exhibits a superiority of mechanical prop￾erties over a wide temperature ranging from 77 to 873 K among
the reported additively manufactured alloys, especially with an
excellent YS of 1180 MPa, UTS of 1586 MPa with total elon￾gation of 22.7 % at 298 K, as well as an ultra-high YS of
1341 MPa, UTS of 1944 MPa with total elongation of 22.6 %
at 77 K. The synergy of precipitation hardening, grain bound￾aries hardening, and dislocation hardening contributes to the
high yield strength, showing a successful combination of pre￾cipitation hardening and additive manufacturing technology.
(3) Planar dislocation slip is the main deformation mechanism
of the as-annealed MEA from 77 to 873 K. The decrease
of SFs with increasing temperature could be ascribed to the
SFE increasing with increasing temperature so that the strain￾hardening rate exhibits temperature dependency. The high
strain-hardening rate at 77 K results from the nano-spaced SFs
networks, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and APBs, which are brought by
the high density of SFs.
(4) No substantial softening and DRX have occurred in the as￾annealed alloy at elevated temperatures over 773 to 873 K. The
coarse discontinuous L12 precipitates along grain boundaries
would induce the intergranular fracture, leading to premature
tensile failure at 773 and 873 K.
(5) Compared to the as-built alloy at the state of solid solution, no
DT is found in the as-annealed alloy. It may be ascribed to the
increasing critical twinning stress derived from the fine channel
width, small grain size, and the high SFE of the L12 phase.
