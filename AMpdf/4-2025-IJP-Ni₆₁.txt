ABSTRACT
Metal additive manufacturing (AM) produces unique grain morphologies owing to the high 
cooling rates and large temperature gradients, which potentially lead to unexpected mechanical 
anisotropy. In this study, we unveil an anomalous anisotropic behaviour in a solid-solution￾strengthened superalloy with periodic columnar-to-crescent grains fabricated by laser powder 
bed fusion (LPBF). Specifically, as-built (AB) specimens show higher strength perpendicular to the 
build direction (BD) than that parallel to the BD at room temperature (RT), while the opposite 
trend occurs at the elevated temperature (ET, 900 ◦C). Besides, the heat treatment eliminates the 
anisotropy of strength at both RT and ET. A dislocation-based damage-coupled crystal plasticity 
finite element (CPFE) model with strain gradients is utilized to understand the origin of the above 
anomalous anisotropy. It is found that the transition of anisotropy from RT to ET is attributed to 
the temperature-dependent dislocation annihilation combined with initial dislocations in AB 
state. In contrast to the heat-treated specimens without anisotropy, the LPBF-induced residual 
deformation primarily contributes to the anisotropy at RT, whereas the initial dislocations 
dominate the anomalous anisotropy at ETs for AB specimens. The CPFE model reveals the 
threshold temperature to be 600 ◦C for the occurrence of anomalous anisotropy, which is 
experimentally validated. This study presents a comprehensive understanding into temperature￾dependent anisotropy of AM superalloys, and in turn guides the regulation of anisotropy by 
tuning microstructures.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing (AM) of superalloys is promising to achieve fast, near-net shaping of hot components in aerospace ap￾plications (Dang et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2024b). Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most precise AM 
technologies, in which a focused laser beam is used to selectively melt a powder bed in a layer-by-layer sequence to build the com￾ponents (Blakey-Milner et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2025). Recently, LPBF technique has been applied to fabricate the superalloy fuel 
nozzles and many other critical parts (Sun et al., 2021). Compared to conventionally manufactured counterparts, LPBF-fabricated 
nozzles have been demonstrated to exhibit reduced weight and enhanced durability, as reported in several studies (NASA, 2023; 
Subeshan et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2021). Moreover, LPBF technique shows potentials to impart superior mechanical properties for 
superalloy components, and offers tunable strength and ductility through various heat treatment strategies (Lu et al., 2023; Song et al., 
2024). Therefore, such advances demonstrate the potential of LPBF technology in fabricating high-performance superalloy compo￾nents for critical applications.
Under high cooling rates (>2 × 105 K/s) and large temperature gradients (>5 × 105 K/m) (Okugawa et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2021), 
some unique LPBF-induced microstructures in superalloys possibly lead to anisotropic mechanical behaviour. A substantial number of 
studies conducted at room temperature (RT) have found that, the LPBF Inconel 718 superalloy exhibited higher strength in the 
horizontal direction (perpendicular to the build direction (BD)) compared with the vertical direction (parallel to BD) (Cui et al., 2023). 
For instance, Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2018) reported that the yield strength (YS) under horizontal tension was 23 MPa higher than that 
under vertical tension in a LPBF K418 superalloy. Similarly, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2023a) demonstrated that horizontal tension 
exhibited a YS that is 101 MPa higher than that of vertical tension for a LPBF GH4099 superalloy. In those studies, numerous columnar 
grains parallel to the BD with strong anisotropy, were formed driven by the temperature gradient in the LPBF process, which was 
summarized as the key reason for the higher YS perpendicular to BD. Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2021) also demonstrated that the HX 
superalloys fabricated under different laser scanning strategies (0◦, 90◦ and 67◦ hatch angles and a chessboard pattern with a 67◦ hatch 
angle) shared a similar anisotropy behaviour at RT. Therefore, the higher YS perpendicular to BD has been widely recognized as a 
common anisotropic behaviour in previous studies at RT, while it remains unknown whether this trend persists at elevated temper￾atures (ETs).
Since superalloys are designed for high-temperature applications exceeding 600 ◦C, it is essential to focus on the mechanical 
properties of LPBF superalloys at ETs (Hu et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024). Unlike the widely recognized anisotropy 
trend at RT, no clear consensus regarding the anisotropic behaviour at ETs has been established for LPBF superalloys (Farias et al., 
2024; Rezaei et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2020). For example, Yu et al. printed an HX superalloy with strong textures and high initial

dislocation density induced by the large temperature gradient and thermal stresses during the LPBF process, which exhibited higher YS 
under horizontal tension across various temperatures (400, 500, 600, and 700 ◦C) (Yu et al., 2020). Farias et al. reported a similar 
anisotropic behaviour for an AM superalloy with only large columnar grains at 1050 ◦C (Farias et al., 2024). In contrast, Rezaei et al. 
reported that an LPBF IN718 superalloy with the transition of columnar-to-crescent grains, exhibited higher strength under the 
horizontal tension at RT, whereas the load-bearing capacity was larger under vertical tension at 650 ◦C (Rezaei et al., 2021). Those 
inconsistent results arise from the AM-induced intricate microstructures such as grain morphology, initial dislocations, and residual 
stresses (Wang et al., 2023). Their effects on macroscopic anisotropy at ETs have not been comprehensively understood.
The anisotropic behaviour of LPBF superalloys is attributed to several AM-induced factors (Bean et al., 2019; Rezaei et al., 2020). 
Previous studies have identified some potential contributors to the anisotropy, including crystallographic texture, orientation of the 
columnar grains, residual stresses formed in the LPBF process, and high initial dislocation densities (Kok et al., 2018; Rezaei et al., 
2020). Moreover, there is a complex coupling relationship among different AM-induced factors, which collectively influence the 
anisotropy of AM alloys (Dai et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024a). Without quantifying the contributions of each LPBF-induced factor, the 
mechanism for the temperature-dependent anisotropy in LPBF superalloys remains an unresolved issue. One critical gap is the lack of 
comprehensive tests for LPBF superalloys to clarify the evolution of anisotropic behaviour from RT to ETs. Another gap is the lack of 
dislocation evolution history, which is crucial for fundamentally understanding the anisotropic behaviour of LPBF superalloys from RT 
to ETs. In this regard, micro-mechanics simulations serve as a powerful tool to bridge this gap.
In this work, a superalloy with representative microstructures is fabricated using LPBF technology. An anomalous anisotropic 
behaviour is revealed through tensile tests conducted on as-built (AB) and heat-treated (HT) specimens from RT to ETs. Then, a 
dislocation-based crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) model is developed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the anomalous 
anisotropy and quantify the contributions of each AM-induced factor. Driven by the strain gradient resulting from periodic columnar￾to-crescent grains, the effect of geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) evolution on tensile behaviour is unveiled. Finally, the 
threshold temperature for the transition of anisotropy is predicted using CPFE simulations, which is validated against experiments. 
This study contributes to understanding and predicting the anisotropic behaviour of AM solid-solution-strengthened superalloys across 
RT to ETs, and also inspires the regulation of anisotropy at varying temperatures by tuning the microstructures.
2. Material and methods
2.1. LPBF fabrication
The spherical gas-atomised SD3230 Ni-based superalloy powder used in this study is produced by Avimetal AM Technology 
(Beijing, China). The powder’s elemental composition is 21.49 Cr - 13.13 W - 2.22 Mo - 1.57 Fe - 1.30 Co - 0.46 Al - 0.34 Mn - 0.30 Si - 
0.029 La - 0.48 C - Bal Ni (weight percent, wt.%). As shown in Fig. 1 b, the powder exhibits notable sphericity, with a nominal powder 
size ranging from 15 to 53 μm and D50 of 30.42 μm. A Concept Laser Mlab 200R (GE, Germany) LPBF machine equipped with a 200 W 
fibre laser source (wavelength = 1070 nm) is employed to print the superalloy. A zig-zag scanning pattern is applied, along with 90◦
rotation in the laser path between layers (Fig. 1 d). All specimens are fabricated under optimised printing parameters (Table 1), 
resulting in a high density exceeding 99.5 % (measured by the Archimedes method), without any microcracks or lack of fusion defects 
being found in the AB state. Moreover, as demonstrated in Appendix D, the crack initiation at LPBF-induced defects is not dominant.
Fig. 1 e illustrates the mechanism of LPBF-induced periodic columnar-to-crescent grains, with formation mechanisms similar to 
those in previous studies (Gokcekaya et al., 2021; Lyu and Zou, 2025; Sun et al., 2019). The rapid solidification and thermal gradients 
during the laser scanning process, lead to the continuous growth of large columnar grains at the regions without the overlap of adjacent 
melt tracks. Meanwhile, due to the remelting at the overlap region, crescent grains form around the large columnar grain during the 
LPBF process. Fig. 1 a shows the sampling arrangement for the tensile specimens which are extracted from printed bulks with a size of 
70 × 2.5 × 20 mm3
. Specimens for vertical and horizontal tension are fabricated to investigate the anisotropy of tensile behaviour for 
the LPBF superalloy from RT to ETs. Moreover, the solid-solution heat treatment is conducted at 1150 ◦C for 2 h (based on the 
ASTM-B572 standard) to eliminate the LPBF-induced residual stresses and initial dislocations (ASTM, 2016), without altering the grain 
morphology (demonstrated in subsequent Section 3.2.1). Since the alloy investigated in this study is a solid-solution-strengthened 
Ni-based superalloy with a low Al content (0.46 wt.%), the formation of γ’ precipitates (Ni3Al) is absent during thermal exposure. 
Consequently, aging treatment is not applied, as it would not contribute to additional strengthening (Adapa et al., 2025).
2.2. Tensile testing
The specific dimensions of the tensile specimens are shown in Fig. 1 c. Uniaxial tensile tests at RT condition are performed using an 
Exceed E44-30 kN (MTS, China) electronic universal testing machine with a strain rate of 0.02 min-1, in accordance with the ASTM E8
standard (ASTM, 2021). A contact extensometer with a gauge length of 25 mm is employed to measure the tensile strain during the RT

tensile tests. A QingJi212 uniaxial tensile testing system (Shanghai, China) is applied to conduct the tensile tests at ETs (600, 900 ◦C), 
in accordance with the ASTM E21 standard (ASTM, 2009). A resistance-heating furnace is used to heat the specimens. A thermocouple 
and a temperature controller are used to maintain the expected temperature. Before the tensile tests at ETs, the specimens are 
pre-heated for 20 min to ensure a uniform temperature distribution. To ensure the reproducibility of the mechanical anisotropy trends 
observed in this study, at least two specimens are tested for each condition (material states, testing temperatures, and loading 
directions).
It should be noted that, although tensile tests are carried out at three temperatures (RT, 600 ◦C,and 900 ◦C), the data at 600 ◦C are 
presented in the discussion (Section 4.4) to validate the threshold temperature for the anisotropy transition. The YS is determined using 
1 % strain offset rather than the conventional 0.2 % offset, to highlight the changes in yielding points under varying temperatures and 
loading conditions, thereby facilitating a clearer presentation of the anisotropic behaviour.
2.3. Microstructure characterisation
The XOY and XOZ planes of the specimens are ground and polished to examine the microstructure features. The specimens are 
initially ground using SiC sandpapers of 320, 600, 1500, and 2500 grit, followed by sequential polishing with diamond suspensions of 3 
μm and 1 μm. Finally, to enhance the quality of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data acquisition, 
the specimens are polished using a 0.04 μm SiO₂ suspension for 50 min. XRD characterisation is performed using a SmartLab 3 kW 
diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The polished surfaces serve as the XRD test surfaces, with measurements con￾ducted over a 2θ range of 40–100◦ at a scanning speed of 3◦/min. EBSD analysis is conducted under a JSM-7800F (JEOL, Japan) field 
emission scanning electron microscope, combined with a NordlysMax3 (Oxford Instructions, Oxford, UK) detector at a 20 kV accel￾eration voltage and a probe current of grade 16. The EBSD scanning area is 800 × 800 μm2
, with a step size of 1 μm. The EBSD data are 
post-processed by ATEX software (Beausir and Fundenberger, 2017), and our in-house code (Guo et al., 2025). Specimens near the 
fracture surfaces are cut into disc-shaped transmission electron microscope (TEM) samples using electrical discharge machining. These 
disc-shaped specimens are then mechanically thinned to 50 μm. Thinning is further performed using a PIPS II 695 precision ion 
polishing system (Gatan, USA), starting at 5 keV, with ion gun angles of ± 8◦ until perforation occurs. Subsequently, the ion beam 
energy is gradually reduced to 4.5 keV at ± 6◦ for 5 min, 4.0 keV at ± 4◦ for 5 min, and finally 3 keV at ± 3◦ for 5 min. The 
microstructure is observed using an FEI Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher, USA) field emission TEM with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
The algorithm mapping GND density based on EBSD data is mainly based on our previous work (Guo et al., 2025), with a brief 
introduction provided below. The local lattice curvature tensor κ is utilized to calculate the Nye tensor α: 
αik = κki − δkiκmm
κij = ∂ϕi
∂xj
(1) 
where ϕi is the misorientation angle regarding i axis, x is the position vector, δki is the Kronecker symbol. The slip system-resolved GND 
densities can be linked with the Nye tensor: 
α = AρGND (2) 
There are 9 constraints provided in Eq. (2), but we have 18 independent variables to be solved in ρGND for FCC metals (Pantleon, 
2008). Thus, we assume that the GND densities exist in the configuration with the lowest total energy, and apply the L1 minimization 
algorithm to estimate the GND density at each slip system (Zhu et al., 2016): 
∑18
n=1
wn
ρn
GND = min (3) 
where wn (1 for edge GNDs, (1-μ) for screw GNDs) is the weight associated with the line energy of dislocations, and n is the GND type.
There are two main limitations in the EBSD-based algorithm for resolving GND density. First, only 5 components in the Nye tensor 
are accessible when using EBSD data as an input (Pantleon, 2008), while the Nye tensor contains 9 components in total. Secondly, due 
to the lack of sufficient constraints for slip system-dependent GNDs, the L1 minimization algorithm is used to approximate the GND 
densities, which could also introduce some errors in the resolved GND densities due to the inadequate constraints. To overcome these 
limitations, 3D EBSD techniques could be employed in future studies.
Moreover, the EBSD data are utilized to map the residual deformation gradient and plastic strians. First, the Nye tensor α is linked 
with Fp0 (Acharya and Bassani, 2000): 
α = (
∇ × Fp0
)T (4) 
Fp0 is estimated through the pseudo-inverse method (Penrose, 1955) based on the α derived from EBSD results, with the detailed 
procedure and validation in our previous work (Hu et al., 2024a). The resolved initial Fp0 in AB state induced by the thermal stresses 
during LPBF process, is employed as the initial plastic deformation gradients in CPFE simulations as the pre-condition, to consider the 
effect of residual stresses. Additionally, this method is also used to capture the residual plastic strain induced by tensile deformation, in 
order to validate the simulated strain partitioning behaviour. The residual Fp resolved using EBSD can be converted into residual 
plastic strains through the Green–Lagrange formation (Dill, 2006).

2.4. Dislocation-based damage-coupled crystal plasticity model
CPFE modeling is employed to understand the anisotropy of LPBF superalloy at RT and ET. The LPBF-induced initial dislocations 
and residual deformation are incorporated in the simulations, which are extracted from EBSD data, with detailed procedures in our 
previous work (Hu et al., 2024a). The GNDs resolved at individual slip systems are introduced to capture the strain gradient effect 
arising from columnar-to-crescent grains. Additionally, the stored energy density (SED) (Wan et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2024), is integrated 
into the CPFE simulations as an indicator to display damage distributions. The details of the crystal plasticity model are presented 
below.
The deformation gradient F can be decomposed into elastic part Fe and plastic part Fp: 
F = Fe Fp (5) 
in which the residual deformation Fp0 formed in the LPBF process is taken as the initial condition of the plastic deformation gradient, to 
capture the effects of residual stresses. The Green–Lagrange elastic strain tensor is written as (Lu et al., 2020; Pedersen, 2005): 
εe = 1
2
(
FT
eFe − I
) (6) 
Then, the stress tensor is calculated as follows (Addessio et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020): 
σ = C : εe (7) 
where C is the elasticity tensor. The shear strain rates γ˙
s across all slip systems collectively contribute to the plastic strain rate (Liu et al., 
2025; Wong et al., 2016): 
˙εp = ˙
FpFp
− 1 = ∑Nslip
s=1
(ss ⊗ ns
)γ˙
s (8) 
where Nslip is the number of slip systems, ss is the unit vector along the slip direction, and ns is the unit vector normal to the slip plane.
The plastic flow rule proposed by Peirce et al. is employed to calculate the slip rate in each slip system (Peirce et al., 1983; Rice, 
1971; Xu et al., 2025): 
˙γs = ˙γref( |τs
|
τs
c(1 − D)
)n
sign(τs
) (9) 
where τs
c is known as the total slip resistance of the slip system (Guo et al., 2024), n is the exponent of the power law, and γ˙ref is the 
reference slip rate.
Under the framework of continuum damage mechanics, the damage variable D is incorporated in the flow rule, to predict the crack 
nucleation, which represents the proportion of reduction in the effective bearing area. The damage variable results from various micro￾defects, such as atomic vacancies and micro-pores formed during the deformation, particularly in ET conditions (Chaboche, 1988; Guo 
et al., 2023). At the moment of D=1, the fraction of micro-defects is high enough to result in macroscopic crack nucleation (Lemaitre, 
1985). Since the damage variable leads to reductions in effective bearing area and stiffness, the τs is replaced by the effective resolved 
shear stress τs
/(1 − D) in Eq. (9). The damage D will be derived from SED subsequently.
The τs
c in Eq. (9) is written as (Bayley et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2023b):

LPBF-induced initial SSD density is uniformly distributed within the simulation domain. Moreover, the GNDs are incorporated to 
consider the extra strengthening effect induced by strain gradients (Arsenlis and Parks, 1999):

where ts = ss × ns is the direction of screw dislocation motion. When implementing Eq. (12), the slip system-dependent accumulated 
slip γs is calculated by integrating the slip increments provided by Eq. (9). Subsequently, the edge and screw GND densities are resolved 
onto each slip system based on the gradients of accumulated slip, according to the original definition of GNDs in Eq. (12). The scalar 
GND and SSD densities defined in Eq. (15) are used to calculate SED.
The SED G is employed as the damage indicator, which represents the internal energy stored around the dislocation structures (Wan 
et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2024):

damage indicator ranging from 0 to 1 is defined as:

(14) 
where Gcr is the critical SED for crack nucleation.
Moreover, the CPFE simulations are performed under the open-source MOOSE framework (Permann et al., 2020). This platform 
facilitates solving the GND densities induced by strain gradients, by using the embedded solver for spatial gradients. The stress-based 
Newton-Raphson iterative solving approach is employed, offering greater computational efficiency. The parameters are calibrated in 
Appendix A, with details of parameter determination provided in Table A.1. It should be noted that all parameters are calibrated 
exclusively using specimens subjected to horizontal tension, while those subjected to vertical tension are used solely for validation of 
Fig. 2. Experimental stress-strain responses: (a, b) Horizontal and vertical tension for AB and HT specimens at RT. (c, d) Horizontal and vertical 
tension for AB and HT specimens at ET (900◦C). The 1% offset of strain is used to determine the YS, in order to highlight the difference in YS 
between various testing cases. Two parallel specimens are used in each test condition to confirm the anomalous anisotropic behaviour, in which the 
fracture consistently occurs within the gauge length. The error bars represent the deviation between the two parallel specimens. In addition, the ‘H’ 
and ‘V’ in all figures are the abbreviations of ‘horizontal tension’ and ‘vertical tension’, respectively.

the calibration results. As shown in Fig. A.1, the calibrated CPFE model successfully reproduces both normal anisotropy (horizontal 
strength > vertical strength) at RT and anomalous anisotropy (horizontal strength < vertical strength) at 900 ◦C for AB specimens, 
respectively. The absence of anisotropy at HT states also can be captured after parameter calibration. Additionally, detailed validations 
on GND and strain distributions are provided in Fig. 7 and Appendix C, respectively. Those comprehensive validations collectively 
support the reliability of the calibrated parameters.
3. Results
3.1. Anomalous anisotropic tensile behaviours from RT to ET
Fig. 2 illustrates the tensile properties of AB and HT specimens under RT and ET conditions. The average values of yield strength 
and total elongation are reported along with their corresponding standard deviations, based on the two specimens tested under each 
condition. At the RT (Fig. 2 a), the AB specimens show higher strength than the HT specimens, with pronounced anisotropy between 
the horizontal and vertical tensions. At the RT, the YS and EL (defined as the fracture EL) of AB-H are found to be 1121.5 ± 9 MPa and 
8.2 ± 0.72 % in average, compared with 1026.5 ± 0.5 MPa and 4.2 ± 0.4 % under AB-V. Heat treatment reduces strength but increases 
the EL, which is consistent with previous studies on AM superalloys (Taller and Austin, 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). The HT-H shows YS of 
775.0 ± 1.0 MPa and EL of 12.6 ± 0.32 %, while HT-V exhibits YS of 773.0 ± 1.0 MPa and EL of 12.8 ± 0.9 %. For AB specimens, the 
differences in YS and EL between horizontal and vertical tensions are about 95.0 MPa and 4.0%. In contrast, for the HT specimens, the

anisotropy is diminished after the heat treatment.
At the ET condition, the AB specimens exhibit higher strength, but lower EL compared with the HT specimens (Fig. 2 c), resembling 
the trends at RT. For the AB specimens, YS and EL are 341.5 ± 2.7 MPa and 7.7 ± 0.3 % under horizontal tension (AB-H), together with 
364.3 ± 3.3 MPa and 15.5 ± 3.5 % under vertical tension (AB-V). After heat treatment, YS and EL change to 275.0 ± 4.0 MPa and 20.0 
± 0.88 % for HT-H, together with 273.0 ± 2.0 MPa and 47.5 ± 5.5 % for HT-V, respectively. Fig. 2 d highlights the anomalous 
anisotropy differing from the trends at RT (Fig. 2 b), indicating that AB-V specimens exhibit about a YS 22.8 MPa higher than AB-H. 
After heat treatment, the anisotropy of YS diminishes, mirroring the trend at RT. In contrast to the tensile behaviour at RT, the tests at 
ET indicate that the EL under vertical tension is roughly twice that under horizontal tension for both AB and HT specimens. It should be 
noted that the EL values exhibit greater dispersion in the AB specimens due to the inherent microstructural heterogeneity. However, 
the YS focused in this paper is highly reproducible, providing a reliable foundation for our analysis of anisotropic behaviour.
Therefore, based on the tensile behaviour shown above, we can summarize the anomalous anisotropic behaviour for the LPBF 
superalloy as follows: 
1. For the AB state, compared with vertical tension, horizontal tension shows higher YS at RT, while exhibiting lower YS at ET.

2. The AB state shows pronounced anisotropy, while no significant anisotropy of YS can be found in the HT state under both RT and 
ET.
3. Compared with vertical tension, the horizontal tension tends to have a lower EL at higher temperatures for both AB and HT 
specimens.
3.2. Microstructures and simulation results
3.2.1. Microstructures
XRD analysis shows that both the AB (Fig. 3 a1) and HT (Fig. 3 b1) specimens exhibit typical face-centred cubic (FCC) austenite 
microstructures. As illustrated in Fig. 3 a1, the (200) diffraction peak appears as the main peak in the AB-XOY and AB-XOZ diffraction 
patterns. During solidification, the FCC grains tend to grow preferentially along the thermal gradient in the <001> direction, resulting 
in a pronounced (200) diffraction peak (Kurz et al., 2023). The (200) peak intensity on the XOZ plane is higher than that on the XOY 
plane (Fig. 3 a1), indicating a stronger temperature gradient-induced crystallographic texture along the BD compared to the OX or OZ 
direction. It is worth noting that XRD characterizes the crystallographic orientation normal to the observation planes. This observation 
is also consistent with a previous study using similar printing parameters (Yin et al., 2022). As shown in Fig. 3 b1, the XRD patterns of 
the HT specimens remain roughly unchanged compared with those of AB specimens. The XRD patterns indicate that the heat treatment 
has minimal effect on the orientation of the texture.
As shown in the EBSD orientation map (Fig. 3 a2), the LPBF-induced large columnar grains exhibit [001] preferred orientation 
along BD, surrounded by crescent grains with random orientations. Fig. 3 b2 indicates that the features of grain orientations remain 
unchanged after the heat treatment, which similarly exhibits the [001] preferred orientation along BD. This is consistent with the XRD 
results. TEM characterisation further confirms that the primary difference in microstructures before and after heat treatment lies in the 
dislocation density. As shown in Fig. 3 a3 and b3, the AB specimen exhibits a dense dislocation network around the sub-grain 
boundaries, while the dislocation density is greatly reduced after heat treatment. The additional TEM observation provided in 
Appendix E further corroborates this trend. These results are consistent with the microstructure evolution of LPBF HX superalloy 
before and after heat treatment in literature (Sun et al., 2021). Previous studies demonstrated that the high initial dislocation density is 
caused by the large temperature gradient and thermal stresses in the rapid solidification process of LPBF (Hu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 
2020).
The aspect ratio distribution (Fig. 3 c) of grains indicates that the grain morphology within the YOZ plane for the AB and HT 
specimens presents a similar periodic pattern of columnar-to-crescent grains. The aspect ratios of the columnar grains mostly exceed 5, 
with those of crescent grains close to 1. Moreover, all the grains observed from the XOZ plane show aspect ratios close to 1. The 
histograms of grain aspect ratio shown in Fig. 3 d-e are utilized to quantify the effect of heat treatment on grain morphology. As shown 
in Fig. 3 d, AB and HT specimens similarly contain 89 % and 83 % of large columnar grains within XOY planes, featuring aspect ratios 
greater than 2. Besides, Fig. 3 e further demonstrates that when viewed from the XOZ plane, the aspect ratios for all grains are close to 
1, without the feature of large columnar grains. Those experimental observations are consistent with the expectation in Fig. 1 e. Within 
the XOZ plane, AB and HT specimens show comparable proportions of crescent grains with aspect ratios less than 2. Thus, the 
quantitative comparisons between the AB and HT states indicate that heat treatment has minimal influence on grain morphology. 
Statistically, within the XOZ plane, the average grain size is 8.2 μm for the AB state and 8.8 μm after heat treatment. Besides, within the 
XOY plane, the average grain sizes are 14.5 μm (AB) and 13.5 μm (HT). Hence, the effect of heat treatment on average grain size is less 
than 10 %, possibly because the heat treatment temperature is insufficient to promote grain growth.
3.2.2. Representative volume element
To reflect the distinctive columnar-to-crescent grain distribution in LPBF superalloys, a representative volume element (RVE) is 
constructed within a domain of 330 μm × 330 μm. As shown in Fig. 4 a-b, the RVE is selected as a single periodic structure for 
columnar-to-crescent grains, including a single columnar grain and surrounding crescent grains. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 c, the grain 
size distributions of simplified RVE and original EBSD are similar in statistics, suggesting that the selected RVE is representative. 
Moreover, as depicted in Appendix B, the simplified RVE closely resembles the orientation distribution of the original EBSD data. It 
should be noted that the same RVE is used for both AB and HT specimens, since no significant changes in grain orientation and 
morphology occur during the heat treatment, as demonstrated in Section 3.2.1. As illustrated in Fig. 4 e, for the finite element model 
with 300 × 300 hexahedral elements, uniform displacement is applied on the BC2 under horizontal tension, and BC1 under vertical 
tension, respectively, while the BC4 and BC3 opposite to the loaded ones are fixed in normal direction as constraints in each case.
By combining Fig. 4 b and d, the grain size mapped with crystal orientations indicates that the large columnar grain shows [001] 
preferred orientation along the BD. In contrast, the crescent grains show randomly distributed crystal orientations. To identify the soft 
and hard zones within the RVE, horizontal or vertical tension is applied to each element, and the stress-strain response of each element 
is obtained based on local single-crystal CPFE simulation, without running the finite-element computation for the whole RVE. Taking 1 
% plastic strain as the criterion of yielding for each element, the local yield strength is mapped in Fig. 4 f and g, indicating that the 
columnar grains are ‘softer’ than crescent grains under both horizontal and vertical tensions. Similarly, this trend resembles the 
uniaxial tensile results of FCC single-crystals, where [100] and [111] orientations exhibit the lowest and highest yield strength 
respectively, with [110] falling between the two (Gupta and Bronkhorst, 2021; Reed, 2008). Therefore, under both horizontal and 
vertical tensions, the large columnar grains and crescent grains can be regarded as the ‘soft’ and ‘harder’ zones, respectively.

3.2.3. Strain, stress and GND distributions
As listed in Table S1, the major difference between the simulations at RT and ET is that, more pronounced dislocation annihilation 
is incorporated at ET, in the evolution equation of ρs
SSD (Eq. (11)). In CPFE simulations, increasing yc is the only approach to reproduce 
the strain softening at ETs, which is observed in experimental stress-strain responses (Fig. 2 c). Physically, the dislocation annihilation 
manifested as the dislocation climb or diffusion, etc., is highly dependent on temperatures (Galindo-Nava and Rivera-Díaz-del-Castillo, 
2012). As a thermally activated process, the dislocation annihilation rate is amplified at ETs (Huang et al., 2009), resulting in a higher 
yc value.
The simulated strain distributions within RVE are exhibited in Fig. 5. At both RT and ETs, the strains normal to the tensile directions 
are significantly localized at the large columnar grain under horizontal tension, whereas the strains are more uniformly distributed 
under vertical tension (Fig. 5 a-b). Those strain distributions under horizontal and vertical tension align well with the measurement 
results in both distribution patterns and magnitudes, as validated in Appendix C. Meanwhile, the strain partitioning between columnar 
and crescent grain zones is quantified in Fig. 5 a3 and b3. Under the horizontal tension, point A within the columnar grain region 
shows a local strain higher than the global average strain, whereas point B within the crescent grain region displays a local strain lower 
than the global strain. Notably, the strain partitioning degree increases with global strain under the horizontal tension. In contrast, the

mechanical model for columnar-to-crescent grains under horizontal and vertical tension.
10

local strains in columnar and crescent grains are comparable to the global strain under the vertical tension, without the enhancement 
in strain partitioning during the whole loading process.
The schematic diagram shown in Fig. 5 c helps to understand the difference in strain patterns between horizontal and vertical 
tensions. As depicted in Fig. 4 f and g, according to the distributions of local yield strength, the columnar and crescent grains can be 
recognized as ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ zones, respectively. Under horizontal tension, due to the absence of soft-to-hard transition within each 
cross-section normal to tensile direction, the columnar and crescent grains are subjected to similar σxx, which is the dominant stress 
component under horizontal tension. Hence, the soft and hard zones can deform independently without significant mutual constraints, 
resulting in the strain εxx localization within the soft columnar grain (Fig. 5 c1). This insight can be reinforced by previous studies on 
strain partitioning of soft-to-hard layered materials under the same loading condition (Zhai et al., 2024). In contrast, under the vertical 
tension, the σyy is re-distributed within each cross-section normal to tensile direction, to maintain the deformation coordination be￾tween soft and hard zones. Due to the mutual constrain between both, there is no significant strain εyy partitioning, which is consistent 
with the previous works regarding the soft-to-hard layered materials under vertical tension (Luo et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2024).
Moreover, under the horizontal tension, the strain localization at columnar grain is more pronounced at ET, compared with that at 
RT (Fig. 5 a1, b1). The quantification analysis in Fig. 5 a3 and b3 also indicates that the strain partitioning degree between the crescent 
and columnar grains is significantly enhanced at ET, compared with that at RT. According to Eq. (11), a higher dislocation annihilation 
rate at ETs could reduce the SSD density and weaken the dislocation strengthening, especially for the columnar grain region with strain 
localization. Consequently, compared with soft grains, the applied deformation more significantly softens the columnar grain at ET 
under horizontal tension throughout the whole deformation process.
The normal stresses along tensile directions distributed across columnar-to-crescent grains are exhibited in Fig. 6. As depicted in 
Fig. 6 a1 and b1, under the horizontal tension, the stresses exhibit relatively uniform distributions across columnar-to-crescent grains 
at both RT and ETs. At each cross-section normal to the horizontal tension direction, the absence of a soft-to-hard transition results in a 
nearly uniform distribution of normal stresses along the tensile direction, without the stress re-distribution typically required to ensure 
deformation coordination along the tensile direction. This simulation result also aligns well with the previous study on layered soft-to￾hard materials under horizontal tension (Zhai et al., 2024). In contrast, the vertical tension features stress localization at the crescent 
grain zone (Fig. 6 a1 and b1), resulting from the stress redistribution induced by deformation coordination (Fig. 5 c2). Under the 
Fig. 6. Stress distributions within columnar-to-crescent grains (5% global strain): (a) Patterns of normal stress along the tensile directions under 
horizontal and vertical tensions at RT. (b) Stress patterns under horizontal and vertical tensions at ET. Both a and b suggest that the stresses are 
concentrated within the region of the crescent grains under vertical tension, and uniformly distributed under horizontal tension.
11

vertical tension, the tensile load is parallel to the lamellar soft and hard zones, in which more elastic strains and corresponding stresses 
need to be assigned to the hard regions of crescent grains (Li et al., 2020), to ensure the deformation coordination. Moreover, 
comparing Figure 6 a2 with b2, the enhanced strain localization at the columnar grain under ET condition amplifies the stress 
localization at crescent grains.
The transition from soft to hard zones further causes strain gradients and GNDs, which provide extra strengthening to the AM 
superalloys (Gao and Huang, 2003; Gao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2020). Thus, it is essential to understand the GND effects arising from the 
columnar-to-crescent grains. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 a-b, the horizontal tension with larger strain gradients across soft to hard zones, 
is selected to display the GND patterns and compare with the experiments. In simulations, the scalar GND density is defined as the 2nd 
norm of GND densities at individual slip systems (Pantleon, 2008; Xu, 2021):

where scalar SSD density is defined with the same expression. As shown in Fig. 7 a-b, the GND patterns at RT and ET exhibit distinctive 
characteristics under horizontal tension. Driven by strain gradients across soft to hard zones, the GND is localized around the columnar 
grain at ET. In contrast, at the RT condition, the GND is localized at the grain boundaries within the crescent grain regions, which is 
induced by the strain gradient at grain boundaries where grain orientation changes (Zhong et al., 2024). Compared with ET, the lower 
EL and weaker strain localization within columnar grain at RT, contribute to the change of scalar GND patterns.
Furthermore, the scalar GND patterns obtained from EBSD are used to validate the simulation results. As depicted in Fig. 7 c-d, GND 
density estimated from EBSD shows comparable magnitude with those in CPFE simulations. Similarly, the GND densities exhibit 
relatively higher magnitudes at ET, compared with those at RT. With the positions of columnar-to-crescent grains indicated by grain 
aspect ratio maps, the GND densities are localized at the columnar grain regions at ET, and exhibit a more diffused distribution within 
crescent grain regions at RT, which are consistent with the simulated GND patterns shown in Fig. 7 a-b. The quantitative comparison 
shown in Fig. 7 e-f demonstrates good agreement between simulation and experiment. Both CPFE-based and EBSD-based GND den￾sities exhibit a peak in the columnar grain region at ET, while showing a more uniform distribution at RT. Moreover, the GND densities 
obtained from both methods are of comparable magnitude, demonstrating the high accuracy of simulated strain gradients and GNDs.
The differences in GND density between the experiment and simulation can be attributed to two main factors. First, the CPFE model 
resolves all components of the Nye tensor, whereas the EBSD-based algorithm captures only 5 components. This discrepancy in the 
GND calculation methods contributes to the relative error. Second, although both the CPFE and EBSD domains exhibit similar features, 
such as the transition of columnar-to-crescent grains, different orientation distributions are used in the simulation and experiment. 
This primarily arises from the lack of EBSD data for the same area in the undeformed state.
4. Discussion
4.1. Mechanism for anomalous anisotropy from RT to ET
The analysis on the number of activated slip systems is utilized to interpret the anisotropy at RT. As shown in Fig. 8 a-b, both 
horizontal and vertical tension show more activated slip systems within the columnar grain, attributed to the lower local yield strength 
(Fig. 4 f-g). Under the same global strain, a smaller number of activated slip systems suggest less complete plastic deformation, which 
in turn contributes to higher strength. Based on the statistical results shown in Fig. 8 c, vertical tension exhibits a higher average 
number of activated slip systems within the RVE, along with a more dispersed distribution as indicated by a higher standard deviation. 
Hence, the more complete slip activation under vertical tension results in lower strength at RT.
The transition of anisotropic behaviour at ETs is understood from the perspective of dislocation strengthening. Compared with the 
cases of RT with strain hardening, enhanced dislocation annihilation is essential to capture the strain softening at ETs for both AB and 
HT specimens (Fig. A.1), which could be the primary contributor of anomalous anisotropy at ETs. The temperature dependence of 
dislocation annihilation will be elaborated in Section 4.4. On the other hand, as depicted in the subsequent GND analysis in Section 4.3
(Fig. 14 a-b), the gradient of grain size-induced GNDs account for less than 10 % of the total dislocation density at the early stage of 
deformation under both RT and 900 ◦C. Moreover, from the stress-strain responses in the cases with and without GNDs (Fig. 14 d-e), 
the GND densities have a neglectable effect on the strength and strain hardening rate at 2 % global strain. Each evidence demonstrates 
that SSDs dominate the dislocation strengthening at the early stage of deformation.
Hence, the incremental scalar SSD induced by applied deformation, is chosen to elaborate the mechanism of temperature￾dependent anisotropic behaviour. In Section 4.4, the Arrhenius-type formula is utilized to capture the temperature dependence of 
critical annihilation distance yc. Despite LPBF-induced initial SSDs, the incremental SSD densities are solely caused by the applied 
deformation during the tension of specimens, which are derived from Eq. (11). As the initial SSDs are assumed to be uniformly 
distributed in CPFE modeling, the incremental SSDs can represent the distribution of total SSDs. The scalar SSD is defined in Eq. (15), 
which is calculated using the SSDs resolved at individual slip systems.
Moreover, it is necessary to elaborate on the initial SSD and GND densities induced by the LPBF process. The thermal gradient 
during the LPBF process produces large thermal stresses, which locally causes plastic deformation and the formation of corresponding 
SSDs (Eq. (11)). Meanwhile, due to the non-uniform distribution of thermal stresses, the GNDs are incorporated to accommodate the 
gradient of plastic deformation (Eq. (12)). Hence, both SSDs and GNDs co-exist in the AB states. Furthermore, the initial GND densities 
are directly extracted from EBSD data, while the uniformly distributed initial SSDs are calibrated by comparing the yield strength of AB 
and HT specimens.
As shown in Fig. 9 a, at the RT with smaller dislocation annihilation, the incremental scalar SSD is concentrated at columnar grain 
under horizontal tension, but exhibits uniform distribution under vertical tension. According to Eq. (11), when the yc is minimal at RT, 
the slip-induced dislocation accumulation produces SSD patterns that well resemble the strain distributions exhibited in Fig. 5 a-b. On 
the contrary, after incorporating more significant dislocation annihilation at ET, both horizontal and vertical tension show negative

increments of SSD, and display a trough of SSD density within the columnar grain. Based on the governing equation of SSD density (Eq. 
(11)), when the annihilation term dominates at ETs in the presence of AM-induced initial SSD, the SSD density could decrease with 
global strain under the applied deformation. The reduction in SSD density at 900◦C will be validated against the subsequent TEM 
observation. As quantitatively shown in Fig. 9 c, the horizontal tension exhibits a peak of incremental SSD within the columnar grain at 
RT, contributing to higher average SSD density, larger average slip resistance τs
c, and higher strength under horizontal tension at RT, 
compared with vertical tension. Furthermore, regarding the horizontal tension at ET, the peak of incremental SSD changes into a 
trough value, as the strain localization within the columnar grain (Fig. 5 b1) enhances the dislocation annihilation, according to Eq. 
(11). However, for the vertical tension, the enhancement in dislocation annihilation at ET has a minor effect on the trend of incre￾mental SSD distributions. Therefore, the dislocation annihilation leads to a more significant reduction in dislocation strengthening 
within the columnar grain under horizontal tension, resulting in a lower YS under horizontal tension compared with the case under 
vertical tension at ET.
The TEM characterization is utilized to validate the simulated dislocation patterns exhibited in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 10, 
compared with the initial dislocation density at AB state (Fig. 3 a3), the applied deformation increases the dislocation density at RT, 
but reduces the dislocation density at ET within both columnar and crescent grain regions, which is consistent with the trends in 
simulations. Moreover, under the horizontal tension at RT, the dislocation density in large columnar grain is higher than that in 
crescent grains (Fig. 10 a and c), whereas the large columnar grain shows lower dislocation density compared with the crescent grains 
at ET (Fig. 10 b and d). Those TEM observations align with the simulated dislocation density patterns.
As demonstrated in Section 3.1, with the temperature increasing, the EL under horizontal tension tends to be lower than that under 
vertical tension. The SED as a widely recognized damage indicator for predicting the microcrack nucleation, is employed to understand 
this trend. As shown in Fig. 11, under both RT and ET, the horizontal tension shows more pronounced SED localization at the columnar 
grain. Furthermore, by comparing Fig. 11 a1 with b1, the SED localization within the columnar grain is more significant at ET. As 
shown in Eq. (13), the SED is derived from plastic dissipative energy that is calculated using stress and plastic strain tensors. Under 
horizontal tension, the average stress within columnar grains is comparable with that in crescent grains to maintain the force balance. 
Hence, without the deformation coordination, the dislocation annihilation-assisted strain softening within columnar grain leads to 
more significant SED or damage localization under the horizontal tension at ET. As a result, compared with vertical tension, the 
horizontal one exhibits lower EL at higher temperatures with enhanced dislocation annihilation.
The EBSD analysis is used to validate the damage distributions shown in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 12 a, the fracture passes through 
Fig. 9. Distributions of incremental scalar SSD density induced by applied deformation (global strain 2%): (a, b) Patterns of incremental SSD

horizontal direction across columnar and crescent grains. For each point on the curves, the data are averaged over the vertical direction within RVE 
to represent the mean trend along the horizontal axis. By comparing the AB-RT-H and AB-ET-H, the peak of incremental SSD density within the 
columnar grain changes into a trough value, after enhancing the dislocation annihilation rate at ET.

the large columnar grains under the horizontal tension at ET. Besides, several long cracks can be found within the columnar grains near 
the fracture surface, indicating that the damage is primarily localized within columnar grains. Moreover, under the vertical tension 
with much larger EL, dense small cracks can be found within the regions of crescent grains (Fig. 12 b), with some long cracks initiating 
at columnar grains, suggesting a more diffused damage distribution. Those experimental observations are consistent with the simu￾lation shown in Fig. 11 b. Therefore, both SED distributions in CPFE simulation and the EBSD analysis of fractured specimens 
consistently indicate that the maximum damage and EL under horizontal tension are primarily governed by strain localization within 
columnar grains. In contrast, under vertical tension, maximum damage and cracking initiated at crescent grains dominate the EL and 
failure behaviour.
4.2. Mechanism for relaxation of strength anisotropy after heat treatment
The CPFE simulations are further employed to understand the mechanisms for the relaxation of strength anisotropy after heat 
treatment. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the HT process can eliminate LPBF-induced initial GNDs, initial SSDs, and residual deformation 
(Fp0), without altering the grain orientations and morphology. Based on the algorithm described in Section 2.4, the initial GND and 
residual deformation obtained from EBSD are shown in Fig. 13 d-e. The initial GNDs localized at grain boundaries introduce aniso￾tropic initial dislocation strengthening, which more significantly enhances the YS for horizontal tension at RT, compared with vertical 
tension (Toursangsaraki et al., 2024). Meanwhile, the LPBF-induced residual strains sharing a similar inhomogeneous pattern with 
initial GNDs, also contribute to enhancing the anisotropy. Moreover, the initial SSD with uniform distribution in CPFE simulations 
amplifies the intrinsic texture-induced anisotropy for columnar-to-crescent grains (Herath et al., 2024). In Fig. 13 a, regarding the 
anisotropy at RT, the initial GND, SSD, and residual deformation are individually incorporated into the CPFE simulations, with the HT 
state as the baseline. As marked in Fig. 13 a, the anisotropy indicator Δ is defined as the strength difference between horizontal tension 
and vertical tension. As quantified in Fig. 13 b, the contributions to the anisotropy enhancement from HT to AB followed the order of 
residual deformation > initial SSD > initial GND at the RT condition.
At the ET condition, the contributions of LPBF-induced factors on anisotropy enhancement are shown in Fig. 13 c. The residual 
deformation and initial GND tend to increase the anisotropy, resembling the behaviour observed at RT. In contrast to the trend at RT, 
the anisotropy at ET is significantly reduced because of the initial SSD. As demonstrated in Fig. 9, the enhanced dislocation annihi￾lation at the columnar grains induces the transition in anisotropy behaviour at ETs, under the prerequisite of enabled initial SSD. In 
other words, the incremental SSD cannot be negative after deformation, if no initial SSD exists. Hence, the initial SSD is the necessary 
16
condition to cause a higher YS under vertical tension at ET, therefore significantly contributing to the reduction of anisotropy at ET.
4.3. Effect of GND evolution
Since the LPBF-induced columnar-to-crescent grains can be regarded as a kind of lamellar gradient microstructures (Li et al., 2020; 
Fig. 11. Distributions of SED as a damage indicator (10% global strain) in AB state: (a) Horizontal and vertical tension at RT. (b) Horizontal and 
vertical tension at ET.
Fig. 12. Grain aspect ratio maps for the microstructures near the fracture in AB specimens at ET (900◦C): (a) Under horizontal tension, indicating 
that the fracture occurs within columnar grains. (b) Vertical tension, suggesting dense small cracks within the crescent grain regions. The grain

Zhu and Wu, 2023), it is essential to understand the extra strengthening effect contributed by strain gradients and GNDs. To analyze 
the impact of GND evolution during the deformation, the ratio of GND density to the total dislocation density is defined as: 
rGND = ρGND
ρGND + ρSSD
(16) 
where the scalar GND and SSD are defined using the L2 norm (Eq. (15)).
The GND strengthening effects at different temperatures and loading directions are shown in Fig. 14. As depicted in Fig. 14 b, under 
the RT with minor dislocation annihilation, the accumulated SSDs constitute most of the total dislocations. Compared with GNDs, the 
higher accumulation rate of SSDs results in rGND decreasing with the global strain. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 14 a, after incorporating 
SSD annihilation at ET, GNDs exhibit an accumulation rate higher than SSD, leading to rGND increasing with the global strain. As a 
result, the extra strengthening induced by GND has a larger impact on stress-strain responses at ET (Fig. 14 d-e). Moreover, by 
comparing Fig. 14 a3 with c, the strain gradients induced by columnar-to-crescent grains induce higher rGND around the columnar 
grain. The reason is that such grain distribution leads to more significant strain localization within columnar grains under horizontal 
tension, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 a-b. Hence, as shown in Fig. 14 e, the GND provides more extra strengthening under horizontal 
tension at ET.
4.4. Threshold temperature for the anisotropy transition
The CPFE model is further used to determine the threshold temperature for the occurrence of anisotropy transition. As previously 
demonstrated, the dislocation annihilation mechanism dominates the anomalous anisotropy. Since the dislocation annihilation is a 
thermally activated process (Huang et al., 2009), the parameter yc governing the dislocation annihilation rate in Eq. (11), could 
monotonically increase with temperature. As schematized in Fig. 15 a, the normal (horizontal strength > vertical strength) and 
anomalous (vertical strength > horizontal strength) anisotropy occurs along with the strain hardening (high yc) and strain softening 
(low yc) at RT and ET, respectively. Hence, there should be a threshold value of yc, at which the horizontal and vertical tensions have 
the same strength with the absence of strain hardening or softening. Since SSDs mainly contribute to the strengthening at the early 
stage of deformation, regarding the yc below and beyond the threshold at RT (strain hardening) and 900 ◦C (strain softening), the 
overall SSD density tends to increase and decrease with slip accumulation, respectively. Therefore, based on Eq. (11), in the presence of 
Fig. 13. Contribution of individual LPBF-induced factors to anisotropy from the HT to AB states: (a) Simulated stress-strain responses obtained from 
different comparative cases, with HT state as the baseline. The initial SSD, initial GND, and Fp0 are individually incorporated in CPFE simulations. 
The parameter Δ in each case is defined as the strength difference between horizontal and vertical tension at 5% global strain. (b) Variation of Δ 
under different LPBF-induced factors at RT. (c) Variation of Δ under different LPBF-induced factors at ETs. (d, e) The initial scalar GND density and

Due to the (|γ˙

where yc < yc,threshold and yc > yc,threshold correspond to SSD density increasing and decreasing with resolved shear strain, respectively. 
Additionally, as demonstrated in Fig. 13 b and Table S1, the initial GND with a magnitude lower than SSD can be neglected. Hence, the

where ρs
SSD,initial is uniformly distributed across slip systems. Regarding the stress-strain responses exhibited in Fig. 2, parameter yc 
beyond and below the threshold correspond to the strain softening at ET, and strain hardening at RT, respectively (Fig. 15 a). 
Furthermore, the classic Arrhenius equation is employed to capture the temperature-dependent yc: 
yc = D0exp(
− RT
Q )
(21) 
where D0 and Q are pre-factor and activation energy, and R is the ideal gas constant. Those two parameters can be calibrated based on 
logarithmic linear regression (Guo et al., 2021), using the values of yc at RT and ET (900 ◦C), respectively.
The calibrated yc as a function of temperature is plotted in Fig. 15 b. Then, based on Eq. (20), the threshold temperature is found as 
600◦C. Accordingly, the CPFE simulations and tensile tests are conducted under 600◦C to validate the prediction. As shown in Fig. 15 c, 
both simulations and experiments show comparable stress-strain responses, in which the anisotropy disappears with the absence of 
both strain hardening and strain softening. These features in experiments align with the predictions. As quantitatively shown in Fig. 15
d, the difference of YS between horizontal and vertical tensions is minor in both simulations and experiments, which provides effective 
validation for the prediction of threshold temperature.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, an anomalous anisotropic behaviour from RT to ETs in a solid-solution-strengthened superalloy LPBF superalloy 
featuring columnar-to-crescent grains is experimentally revealed, with the underlying mechanisms elucidated through CPFE

simulations. The main conclusions of this study can be summarised as follows. 
1. Compared with vertical tension, horizontal tension shows YS higher at RT, but exhibits lower YS at ET (900 ◦C). The transition of 
anisotropy from RT to ET is governed by the temperature-dependent dislocation annihilation within the columnar grains, with the 
threshold temperature predicted to be 600 ◦C.
2. Compared with HT state, the enhancement of anisotropy in AB state is attributed to several LPBF-induced factors, ranked in order of 
impact: residual deformation > initial SSD > initial GND at RT, and initial SSD > initial GND > residual deformation at ET.
3. Damage is localized within large columnar grains under horizontal tension, resulting in lower EL compared to vertical tension in 
both the AB and HT states. This effect becomes more pronounced at ETs due to enhanced damage localization facilitated by 
dislocation annihilation.
4. The strain gradient provides a more significant strengthening effect at ETs owing to a high GND ratio, particularly in horizontal 
tension, where the higher GND density arises from columnar-to-crescent grain structures.
This paper presents an integrated work for understanding and predicting the anisotropic behaviour of AM superalloys. In the future 
study, the grain morphology could be tailored using AM technique, to achieve the tunable temperature-dependent anisotropy adapted 
to various applications.

Appendix A. Parameters calibration
The stress-strain curves under horizontal tension exhibited in Fig. 2, are utilized to calibrate the CPFE parameters at RT and ET, 
respectively. Specifically, the curves of HT specimens are employed to calibrate most of the parameters, except for LPBF-induced initial 
SSD. Then, after the incorporation of LPBF-induced initial GND and residual deformation obtained from EBSD results, the curves of AB 
specimens are utilized to calibrate the intensity of initial SSD that is uniformly distributed within the simulation domain. With all the 
calibrated parameters listed in Table A.1, the stress-strain curves under vertical tension are employed to validate the CPFE model. As 
shown in Fig. A.1, CPFE simulations can reproduce the two key features of anomalous anisotropy summarized in Section 3.1 (items 1 
and 2).

Appendix D. Fractured surface morphology
The SEM fractography (Fig. D.1) exhibits multi-source crack initiation and dimpled rupture, free from defect-induced microcracks 
initiation. This implies that mechanical responses are dominated by LPBF-induced crystallographic texture and initial dislocation 
density, rather than volumetric defects inherent to LPBF.

Appendix E. Additional TEM observations of the AB and HT specimens
In addition to Fig. 3 a3 and b3, more TEM observations under the same conditions are conducted (Fig. E.1). This confirms that the 
AB specimens generally exhibit a high density of dislocations, whereas the HT specimens show a significant reduction in dislocation 
densities. Thus, although Fig. 3 a3 and b3 are not captured at the same location, they are representative to reflect the uniform 
reduction in dislocation densities across the specimens upon heat treatment.
