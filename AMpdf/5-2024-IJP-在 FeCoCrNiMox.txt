ABSTRACT
The application of structural metals in extreme environments necessitates materials with superior 
mechanical properties. Mo-doped FeCoCrNi high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as po￾tential candidates for use in such demanding environments. This study investigates the high￾temperature performance of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs with varying Mo contents (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 
and 0.5) prepared by laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. The mechanical properties 
were evaluated at room and 600 ◦C temperatures, and the microstructures were characterized 
using scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The intrinsic dislocation cell patterning, 
solid-solution strengthening, nanoprecipitation, and twinning effects collectively modulated the 
plastic deformation behavior of the samples. The high-temperature mechanical performance was 
comprehensively analyzed in conjunction with ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics 
simulations to reveal the origin of the experimentally observed strength–ductility synergy of 
FeCoCrNiMo0.3. This study has significant implications for FeCoCrNiMox HEAs and extends our 
understanding of the structural origins of the exceptional mechanical properties of additively 
manufactured HEAs.

entropy alloys (HEAs) have significantly broadened the compositional space of metals owing to their unique physical, chemical, and 
mechanical properties. Face-centered cubic (FCC) FeCoCrNi-based HEAs exhibit excellent mechanical properties, including high 
strength, hardness, and wear resistance. (Beyr amali Kivy and Asle Zaeem, 2017; He et al., 2018). The most renowned variant, 
equiatomic FeCoCrNiMn (Shahmir et al., 2023), tends to form with a low stacking fault energy (SFE) of ~20 mJ/m2 (Huang et al., 
2015).1
However, despite the satisfactory mechanical properties of single-phase FeCoCrNi-based HEAs at room and low temperatures 
(Gludovatz et al., 2014; Kuzminova et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2017), the high-temperature mechanical performance requires further 
improvement. For instance, Liao et al. (2023) explored the compression behavior of equimolar FeCoCrNi HEAs, and noticed a softening 
effect at elevated temperatures owing to increased grain boundary migration and thermal activation of the matrix. This pronounced 
softening effect significantly reduces the strength and plasticity of FeCoCrNi-based HEAs at 600 ◦C (Lin et al., 2022). During defor￾mation, nanoclusters cause cracks to form at the grain boundaries, leading to a loss of ductility at high temperatures. Similarly, the 
high-temperature tensile properties of FeCoCrNiMn show evident softening at 600–700 ◦C, resulting in poor performance at high 
temperatures (Jo et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022).
To enhance the high-temperature mechanical properties of HEAs, significant progress has been made in controlling precipitation 
(Yang et al., 2020) and alloying-element segregation at grain boundaries (Hou et al., 2022). Gan et al. (2024) introduced D022 
nanoparticles into an FCC HEA, which increased the dislocation storage capability and strain hardening, greatly improving the tensile 
properties in the 600–700 ◦C range. Researchers have also achieved improvements in strength and plasticity at 750 ◦C by doping the 
FCC matrix with elements such as Ti, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W to reduce the SFE and introduce nanoscale L12 precipitates, resulting in 
various work-hardening behaviors (Gao et al., 2024). Therefore, adding trace elements and introducing nanoscale precipitates into the 
FCC matrix is a promising strategy for improving the high-temperature performance.
The addition of medium-atomic-size Mo to the FeCoCrNi matrix can induce precipitation strengthening in the solid-solution FCC 
phase and even trigger a eutectic precipitation reaction (Guo et al., 2020). Consequently, Mo-doped FeCoCrNi HEAs exhibit enhanced 
mechanical properties, including good wear resistance (Fan et al., 2024), corrosion resistance (Dai et al., 2020; Yen et al., 2024), and 
biocompatibility (Hiyama et al., 2024). By controlling the Mo content, phase selection can be achieved to alter the structure and 
properties of the HEAs, which is crucial for regulating the performance.
Dai et al. (2021) reported the effect of grain size on the mechanical properties of FeCoCrNiMo0.1. The mechanical performance at 
− 196.15 ◦C was superior to that at 0 ◦C because of twinning-induced plasticity. By comparison, FeCoCrNiMo0.2 has a higher activation 
energy, and the matrix and precipitate phases segregate during deformation at elevated temperatures (Wu et al., 2018). The enhanced 
slip reversibility is attributed to improved slip planarity owing to the addition of Mo, which results in a decreased SFE and increased 
lattice friction stress and shear modulus. Moreover, the stacking-fault-mediated deformation mechanism in FeCoCrNiMo0.2 helps to 
inhibit fatigue-induced plastic deformation (Li et al., 2019). Cai et al. (2017) discovered that Mo-rich intermetallic compounds pre￾cipitate in FeCoCrNiMo0.23 upon annealing. However, the bonding force between the intermetallic compounds and matrix is weak, and 
the probability of stacking faults is reduced, thus suppressing the formation of deformation twins and resulting in a tradeoff between 
strength and ductility. Liu et al. (2016) found that in FeCoCrNiMo0.3, the precipitation of hard σ and μ phases greatly strengthens the 
material (tensile strength of up to 1.2 GPa) without causing severe embrittlement. Shun et al. (2012) reported that with an increase in 
the Mo content in cast FeCoCrNiMox, the strength increases, whereas the plasticity decreases. Aged FeCoCrNiMo0.85 has a higher 
hardness than aged FeCoCrNiMo0.3 and FeCoCrNiMo0.5 owing to the precipitation of a larger volume fraction of hard needle-like σ 
phases in the FCC matrix. However, these studies mostly focused on the influence of Mo on the mechanical properties, without 
considering the effect of temperature in detail. In particular, few studies have evaluated the high-temperature mechanical properties 
and microstructural evolution of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2017), and systematic and in-depth studies on the 
high-temperature mechanical properties and intrinsic deformation mechanisms of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs are lacking.
Laser-based additive manufacturing (L-AM) is an advanced precision manufacturing technique that facilitates high-throughput 
fabrication and offers significant opportunities for in situ materials design with tailored microstructures (Li et al., 2022). An et al. 
(2023) revealed that L-AM-processed FCC metals have hierarchical microstructures that exhibit several plastic deformation mecha￾nisms, thereby enhancing the mechanical performance compared with conventionally fabricated counterparts. Notably, the unique 
dislocation cell patterns, which are caused by residual stresses arising from the large temperature gradient and thermal cycling during 
L-AM, significantly contribute to the strength (He et al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2022). Sui et al. (2022) investigated L-AM-processed 
FeCoCrNiMo and reported that its hierarchical eutectic and irregular lamellar structures resulted in high hardness and wear resistance. 
Furthermore, in our previous work, we demonstrated the capability of L-AM for fabricating FeCoCrNiMox (x = 0.3 and 0.5) HEAs with 
good mechanical properties (Lin et al., 2024, 2023). Deformation twinning and micro/nanoprecipitates such as σ phases were 
observed when the Mo fraction exceeded 0.3.
In this study, we utilized laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing to fabricate a series of defect-free FeCoCrNiMox 
HEAs with varying Mo contents (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5). The mechanical properties and microstructural evolution were systematically 
investigated at room and elevated temperatures. The thermal stability and uniaxial tensile deformation behavior were studied by 
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, ab initio calculations and molecular

dynamics (MD) simulation models were established to quantify changes in the microscale lattice strain and stacking fault probability 
associated with plastic deformation. This work provides a quantitative assessment of the effects of the hierarchical microstructure on 
the mechanical response of L-PBF-processed FeCoCrNiMox HEAs, which is beneficial for enhancing their high-temperature perfor￾mance as structural materials.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Powder preparation and L-PBF process
To fabricate the FeCoCrNiMox HEAs (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5; Mo content = 0, 2.44, 6.98, and 11.11 at%, respectively), denoted as 
Mo0, Mo1, Mo3, and Mo5, respectively, equiatomic FeCoCrNi and FeCoCrNiMo powders with spherical particles (diameter: 15–53 μm) 
were produced by gas atomization. The powders were then mixed at different molar ratios in a three-dimensional mixer at 40 rpm for 5 
h under a protective Ar atmosphere (Fig. 1a). Next, L-PBF was conducted using a RENISHAW AM-400 platform with a preheating 
temperature of 120 ◦C. The processing parameters were as follows: bidirectional scanning speed, 750 mm/s; laser power, 200 W; hatch 
spacing, 80 μm (Mo0, Mo1, and Mo3) or 70 µm (Mo5); layer thickness, 40 µm; and rotation between layers, 67◦. Blocks with

dimensions of 80 × 40 × 20 mm were fabricated (Fig. 1b).
2.2. Mechanical testing
Mechanical testing was conducted using dog-bone samples (room-temperature tests) or rod-shaped samples (high-temperature 
tests) (Fig. 1c). The samples were extracted from the center of the L-PBF-processed blocks via electrical discharge machining. Tensile 
tests were performed until failure using a 3910-type microcomputer-controlled electronic universal testing machine at a crosshead 
speed of 0.5 mm/min (initial strain rate: ~3 × 10− 4 s
− 1
).
2.3. Microstructural characterization
The microstructural characteristics and fracture surfaces of the tensile samples were characterized using field-emission scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM; ZEISS-EVO 18) in backscattered electron mode and EBSD. Field-emission TEM (FEI-Tecnai G2 F30) and 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze the microstructures and chemical compositions of the samples. The 
crystal structure and dislocation morphology of the matrix and secondary phases were characterized by TEM. The microstructural 
evolution of Mo5 was characterized by SEM, EBSD, EDS, and TEM.
2.4. Ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
Ab initio calculations were conducted using density functional theory (DFT) (Hohenberg and Kohn, 1964), employing the exact 
muffin-tin orbitals method to solve the Kohn–Sham equations (Andersen et al., 1995; Vitos, 2001; Vitos et al., 2000). The Per￾dew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional was used for self-consistent determination of the charge density and total 
energy (Perdew et al., 1996). Given that the magnetic ordering temperature of FeCoCrNi is well below room temperature, all 
spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed assuming a paramagnetic state (Gyorffy et al., 1985). The paramagnetic state was 
described using a disordered local moment approach. The coherent potential approximation was employed to model the chemical 
disorder (Gyorffy, 1972; Vitos et al., 2001).
For SFE calculations, we followed the methodology described by Schonecker ¨ et al. (Schonecker ¨ et al., 2021). The thermal lattice 
expansion and magnetic contributions were considered to account for the temperature dependence of the SFE. Specifically, we derived 
the lattice expansion of the FCC phase by minimizing the free energy F(V, T) = EPM(V) − TSPM(V) + Fvib(V, T) over the atomic volume V 
for a given temperature T, where EPM and SPM are the total energy and magnetic entropy of the paramagnetic state, respectively, and 
Fvib is the vibrational free energy. Next, the FCC lattice parameter corresponding to a certain T was employed to calculate the SFE,

considering the contributions from EPM and SPM. Fvib of the FCC phase was calculated using the Debye–Grüneisen model (Moruzzi et al., 
1988). SPM was calculated with consideration to the transverse degrees of freedom using the mean-field expression for uncorrelated 
magnetic moments (Grimvall, 1975).
The open-source MD simulation software, LAMMPS, is employed for the uniaxial stretching simulation (Plimpton, 1995). The 
potential function used is the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential for six elements (Ni-Cr-Co-Mo-V-Al) developed by 
Wang et al. (2023), and it is incorporated into the HEA model’s machine learning through a neural network. Liu et al. (2024) and (Shi 
et al., 2024) respectively used this potential function to verify the deformation mechanisms of medium entropy alloy (MEA) and HEAs, 
achieving ideal results. The uniaxial tensile simulations of the single crystal nanowire are conducted at two temperatures: 25 ◦C and 
600 ◦C. For visualization, the open-source software OVITO is used.
To obtain atomic models with random elements distribution, we first conducted energy minimization on the initial models, fol￾lowed by relaxation for 20 ps at 25 ◦C. Using a combination of MC atom swaps and MD hybrid method, we constructed atomic models 
for alloy containing CSRO based on the initial models. After MC simulation, we annealed the model from 1227 ◦C to 25 ◦C and 600 ◦C at 
a 1 ◦C/ps rate. For a second lattice relaxation under canonical ensemble (NVT), we switched the model to non-periodic boundary 
conditions on the x, y, and z axes. The y-direction deformation is performed at an engineering strain rate of 2 × 108 s
− 1
. At the top and 
bottom regions of the simulation box, rigid blocks containing immobile atoms were positioned. A constant velocity was applied to 
these blocks in opposite directions to deform the model. Free boundary conditions were established on the planes parallel to the 
loading axis. During the tensile process, velocity rescaling was performed at every step. While this may influence the thermal con￾ductivity analysis of HEAs, both the literature (Chen et al. 2021) and our research (Liu et al. 2024) indicate that this approach stabilizes 
the deformation temperature, with negligible impact on deformation twinning. We compared velocity rescaling every 1, 5, 10, and 100 
steps, as well as a case with no rescaling. The lack of thermal energy in the system does not significantly affect the MD simulation 
results.
In the simulation process, the strain rate is actually 108
–109
s
− 1
.(Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024) This calculation speed is closer 
to the experimental results in macroscopic experiments, although there is a large gap between the calculation speed and the actual 
speed. However, due to the effects of size effects, etc., it is possible to qualitatively analyze the deformation mechanism.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Mechanical properties
Figs. 2a and 2b show the uniaxial tensile stress–strain curves of the as-built L-PBF-processed samples with varying Mo contents 
(Mo0, Mo1, Mo3, and Mo5) at temperatures of 25 and 600 ◦C. At room temperature, Mo enhances both the strength and ductility 
(Table 1). Compared with Mo0, the yield strength (YS) of Mo1 increases from 566 to 609 MPa and the ductility increases from 19% to 
27%. Mo3 and Mo5 exhibit even higher room-temperature mechanical properties.
The mechanical performance of all samples decreases significantly at elevated temperatures, with their YS and ultimate tensile 
strength (UTS) varying considerably. The ductility of Mo0 is less than 10%, indicating its unsuitability for high-temperature appli￾cations. Mo1 displays dynamic strain strengthening during high-temperature tensile loading; however, its ductility is still less than 
10%. A notable disparity is observed in the high-temperature tensile performance of Mo3 and Mo5. For Mo3, the YS, UTS, and uniform 
elongation at 600 ◦C are 20%, 57%, and 1513% higher, respectively, than those of Mo0. The strain hardening of Mo3 is essentially the 
same as that at room temperature (Fig. 2c). Consequently, it demonstrates a successful balance between strength and ductility at high 
temperatures. By contrast, the ductility of Mo5 approaches the lower limit of the acceptable range (10%).
At 600 ◦C, Mo1 exhibited significant serrated flow behavior, whereas Mo0, Mo3, and Mo5 did not show this phenomenon at this 
temperature. It can be seen that at the same temperature, serrated flow behavior is closely related to the Mo content. The essence of 
serrated flow is the pinning effect of solute atom clusters on dislocations, which increases the flow stress. When the flow stress increases 
to a certain value, the dislocations break through the solute clusters, causing a sudden drop in flow stress. These two actions alternate, 
forming the serrated flow behavior. In Mo0, no Mo element was added, and the structure contains only Fe, Co, Cr, and Ni elements, 
with atomic radii of 124.1, 125.3, 124.9, and 124.6 Å, respectively. Since the atomic diameters are relatively close, the lattice 
distortion effect is not significant, and the pinning effect of solute atoms on dislocation motion is low. Thus, no serrated flow behavior 
occurs. In Mo1, Mo atoms (with a diameter of 136.3 Å) aggregate into solute clusters near dislocations, significantly increasing the

resistance to dislocation motion, leading to the formation of serrated flow behavior. As the Mo content further increases, the sluggish 
diffusion effect of HEAs gradually suppresses the diffusion behavior of solute atoms, reducing the tendency to form solute atom clusters 
around dislocations, thereby eliminating serrated flow behavior.
From the perspective of material plasticity, the plasticity of Mo1 at 600 ◦C is much higher than that of Mo0. Our previous research 
(Lin et al., 2022) has revealed that the high-temperature brittleness of Mo0 is caused by the nanocluster formation of elements at the 
grain boundaries. Therefore, the addition of Mo in Mo1 and Mo3 improves the bonding strength at the grain boundaries, enhancing 
high-temperature plasticity. The slight decrease in plasticity of Mo5 compared to Mo3 is due to the embrittlement caused by the 
growth of the σ phase.
Fig. 2d compares the high-temperature (>600 ◦C) mechanical properties of various FeCoCrNi-based HEAs, Ti-based alloys, and Ni￾based superalloys. Mo3 and Mo5 exhibit comparatively remarkable mechanical performance, particularly regarding the 
strength–ductility trade-off. This advancement demonstrates the potential of these alloys for use in high-temperature environments.
3.2. Initial microstructures of L-PBF-processed FeCoCrNiMox HEAs
For a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind the changes in performance, we conducted a detailed micro￾structural analysis. Fig. 3 presents SEM images of the additively manufactured FeCoCrNiMox HEAs. The samples are nearly defect-free, 
although a few small round pores (<1 µm) are visible near the fusion lines. Moreover, a distinct dendritic structure is concentrated at 
the overlaps of the melt pools, with clear dendrite and interdendrite regions (Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c, insets). In comparison with Mo0 
(Fig. 3a), the Mo-containing samples exhibit sharper dendrites (Figs. 3b and 3c). Because of the significant temperature gradient and 
thermal cycling during L-PBF, the initial solidification occurs faster at the top of the molten pool than at the bottom (Hu et al., 2022; 
Munusamy and Jerald, 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). This results in dendritic growth at the top of the pool, whereas the bottom maintains 
planar crystal growth. Small grains form in the intersecting areas of the melt pools (Fig. 3d, inset). Therefore, the additively manu￾factured FeCoCrNiMox HEAs exhibit microstructural heterogeneity, with a grain size distribution of a few microns to tens of microns.
Fig. 4 presents the EBSD results of the as-built FeCoCrNiMox HEAs. From the inverse pole figure maps, the Mo0 grains show a clear 
tendency to grow along the direction of construction (z direction). This is attributed to the thermal gradient and optimal solidification 
orientation (Korner ¨ et al., 2020). Thus, the grains have a unidirectional epitaxial columnar shape. In addition, the matrix exhibits a 
relatively obvious 100<111> texture, as illustrated in the pole figure in Fig. 4a3. However, the introduction of Mo induces notable 
changes (Figs. 4b1, 4c1, and 4d1), with a more random grain orientation. Furthermore, the average grain size increases from 35.1 μm 
for Mo0 to 57.5 μm for Mo3. Given that Mo is a refractory element, a higher energy density is required for preparation. Therefore, the

structure is concentrated at the overlap of the molten pool. Small grains generate in the intersection area of the molten pool.

average geometrically necessary dislocation density of Mo3, as calculated from the kernel average misorientation, is similar to that of 
Mo0. The microstructural characteristics are summarized in Table 2.
The variations in the grains (orientation, recrystallization, and size) of the FeCoCrNiMox HEAs highlight the complex interplay 
between the composition and processing parameters, resulting in differences in the mechanical properties. Overall, the multiscale 
heterogeneity is derived from microscale lattice defects (Zhang et al., 2018), requiring more geometrically necessary dislocations to 
achieve microstructural deformation during L-PBF. As shown in Fig. 4d3, Mo5 contains a few recrystallized grains, whereas most 
grains are substructured and deformed, indicating a high dislocation density. In addition to the high density of dislocation cells caused 
by thermal residual stress, slow elemental diffusion within HEAs is also considered to hinder recrystallization (Miracle and Senkov, 
2017). The fraction of partially recrystallized grains is affected by the Mo concentration (Ming et al., 2019), as well as laser-induced 
structural deformation (Peng et al., 2024)and precipitation (He et al., 2021a). The recrystallized fraction of the FeCoCrNiMox samples 
varies from 2.9% to 13.3%, which will affect the dislocation hardening behavior during tensile deformation.
Fig. 5 shows the dislocation morphology and elemental segregation of the FeCoCrNiMox HEAs, as characterized by TEM and EDS. 
Laser-printed samples typically exhibit hexagonal dislocation cell patterns because of residual stresses during solidification (He et al., 
2022). However, the dislocation cell patterns are not obvious in Mo0. As the Mo content increases, the dislocation cell features become 
more obvious and the cell walls become sharper. The cell wall thickness decreases from approximately 200 nm for Mo1 to 50 nm for 
Mo5, and the cell size increases slightly. Some stacking faults can also be observed in Mo5.
Mo3 and Mo5 contain rod-shaped nanoscale σ-phase precipitates at the grain boundaries (Figs. 5c and 5d). This is because Mo, a 
refractory metal with a large atomic radius, is likely to be enriched at locations with large lattice distortions, such as grain boundaries,

which act as nucleation sites. Segregated Cr/Mo solutes can also redistribute or diffuse into mobile grain boundaries during matrix 
growth (He et al., 2021a), thereby promoting σ-phase nucleation along the grain boundaries. The diffusion rate of Mo is much slower 
than that of Cr. In addition, it is present in relatively lower concentrations than the other elements in the HEA. Therefore, it is primarily 
Cr (He et al., 2021a)that partitions into the σ phase. In addition to the nanoscale σ-phase precipitates, blocky μ-phase precipitates can 
also be observed (Cr-rich Mo). The μ-phase precipitates appear at the edges of the σ-phase precipitates, indicating that they may be 
generated by transformation of the σ phase during solidification. Sui et al. (Sui et al., 2022) credited μ-phase formation to the lattice 
strain produced by excessive Mo, which makes the σ phase unable to maintain its tetragonal structure. The release of lattice strain

causes the σ phase to transform into the rhombohedral μ phase. Furthermore, supersaturated Mo induces σ-phase formation along the 
grain boundaries, which effectively inhibits the formation of Mo-containing alloy through the pinning effect and can effectively delay 
recrystallization and grain growth (Linder et al., 2024; Miracle and Senkov, 2017).
3.3. Microstructural evolution of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs during deformation at 25 and 600 ◦C
Fig. 6 shows TEM images of near-neck regions of the samples deformed at room temperature. These images demonstrate the 
distinctive role of twinning in the room-temperature plastic deformation of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs. However, there is a notable variation 
in the density and width of twins across different samples. Specifically, the presence of twins in the Mo0, Mo1, and Mo3 samples is 
more pronounced compared to the Mo5 sample, where the number is relatively small, as shown in Fig. 6d2. This suggests that the 
critical stress required for twin activation in the as-built Mo5 sample is significantly higher than the other samples, even though it 
exhibits greater strength and ductility than the Mo0 and Mo1 HEAs. This is primarily due to the presence of a significant amount of σ 
precipitates (Fig. 5) in Mo5. These precipitates can partially hinder the movement of dislocations, thereby preventing the formation of 
stacking faults in the matrix (Cai et al., 2017). Consequently, this reduces the likelihood of stacking faults, and further decreases the 
probability of twin formation. Additionally, the significant plastic deformation during the stretching process in Mo3, combined with 
the lower quantity of σ precipitates, leads to a much higher number of twins in Mo3 compared to Mo5.
According to Table 1, the strength of Mo0 and Mo1 decreased by 40% at high temperatures, while the ductility of Mo3 and Mo5 
only decreased by 30%. Moreover, Mo3 and Mo5 retained a higher percentage of elongation. To understand this difference, we 
conducted high-temperature fracture surface TEM analysis. Fig. 7 displays the TEM characterization results of the near-necking po￾sition of samples with different Mo contents after deformation at high temperatures. We observed that due to the lack of precipitates 
hindering their movement, the grains in the Mo0 and Mo1 samples were significantly elongated post-deformation. These lamellar grain 
boundaries act as strengthening barriers, accumulating intragranular dislocations and consequently reducing the ductility of the 
samples. In the Mo3 and Mo5 sample, some cellular dislocations remained visible, and short rod-shaped precipitates of the σ phase 
were located on the dislocation cell wall. These precipitates played a pinning role in the movement of the dislocation cell, contributing 
to its high-temperature stability. It is worth noting that in the Mo3 and Mo5 samples, the hindrance of dislocation motion by pre￾cipitates results in the accumulation of a large number of dislocations at grain boundaries. This leads to stress concentrations exceeding 
the critical twinning stress level, causing the formation of deformation twins. This indicate that in addition to the dislocation coor￾dination deformation observed in Mo0 and Mo1, twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) effects also came into play. Since the deformation 
temperature does not reach the secondary precipitation temperature of the σ phase, the ratio of precipitates will not increase further 
during the high-temperature deformation process (Elmer et al., 2007). High-density dislocations pile up along the hard σ-phase 
precipitates, hindering further dislocation slip. The excessive σ-phase cannot deform coherently with the matrix, leading to cracking 
under low plastic deformation conditions. As a result, stress concentration-induced cracking occurs earlier in Mo5 than in Mo3 sample 
during tensile deformation.

3.4. Fracture morphology of Mo3 and Mo5 at 25 and 600 ◦C
To elucidate the fracture mechanisms of the Mo3 and Mo5 samples, we conducted an analysis of the fracture surfaces of the tensile 
specimens at 25 ◦C and 600 ◦C. Fig. 8 illustrates the room-temperature fracture morphologies of Mo3 and Mo5. The fracture surfaces 
are characteristic of FCC materials, with high densities of tears and dimples. Under uniaxial loading, the initial crack extends in the 
tensile direction, forming voids during the crack extension stage. The connections between these voids result in fractures. Some 
tongue-shaped pits or protrusions formed by extension of the cleavage cracks along the twin boundaries are visible (Fig. 8b2). This 
phenomenon is consistent with the findings of Sui et al. (Sui et al., 2022). Fig. 8a3 indicates that the molten pool boundary is sus￾ceptible to fracture.
Fig. 9 illustrates the high-temperature fracture morphologies of Mo3 and Mo5. The fracture surface of Mo3 still exhibits ductile 
fracture characteristics, albeit with a diminished presence of dimples as compared to that at room temperature. The emergence of twins 
during the latter stages of deformation renders the fracture surface akin to the room-temperature fracture surface of Mo5, with tongue￾shaped cleavage crack patterns. By contrast, the high-temperature fracture surface of Mo5 exhibits quasi-cleavage traits. Cleavage 
steps are formed by fracture along the crystal planes at varying heights. The fracture surface of Mo5 (Fig. 9b2) is considerably flatter 
than that of Mo3 (Fig. 9a2), suggesting that the fracture strain was relatively constrained during the tensile process. This observation 
aligns with the high-temperature tensile stress–strain curves. The presence of σ-phase precipitates, which are hard and brittle inter￾metallic compounds, enhances the compressive strength but concurrently reduces the fracture strain.

Comparing the room- and high-temperature tensile fracture morphologies of Mo3 and Mo5 reveals a trend of transition and 
transformation in the fracture characteristics, suggesting that the strength of additively manufactured FeCoCrNiMox HEAs can be 
significantly enhanced by adding an appropriate amount of Mo. Moreover, it potentially reveals the Mo content window for tuning the 
mechanical properties of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs.

3.5. Solidified phase equilibrium state of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs
The σ-phase is brittle, and therefore, its presence is generally detrimental for long-term applications. However, in this study, the 
addition of Mo promoted the precipitation of the σ-phase at grain boundaries, which further hindered cell deformation at high 
temperatures. Additionally, the pinning effect suppressed grain boundary migration, enhancing the high-temperature strength and 
plasticity of the HEA. Therefore, it is necessary to study the precipitation behavior of the σ-phase. Fig. 10 presents the change in the 
phase and element ratios during the solidification of the melt pools for different samples. The melting point (Tm) of the HEAs decreases 
from 1446 ◦C for Mo0 to 1381 ◦C for Mo5 (Fig. 10a). The FCC matrix forms from the liquid phase during solidification, accompanied by 
σ-phase precipitation for the Mo-doped HEAs. The onset of FCC solidification and σ-phase precipitation occur at different solid-phase 
molar fractions, although the step distance (molar amount) is much shorter for Mo3 than for Mo1 and Mo5. In fact, σ-phase precip￾itation in Mo3 begins almost simultaneously with the solidification of the FCC matrix.
Mo1 and Mo5 exhibit a similar trend in terms of the solid-phase content (Figs. 10b and 10c), which is quite different from that of 
Mo3 (Lin et al., 2023). In Mo3, the Mo-rich σ phase precipitates first, followed by simultaneous precipitation of the FCC and σ phases. 
By contrast, in Mo1 and Mo5, the Mo-rich σ phase precipitates later in the solidification process. As summarized in Fig. 10d, nanosized 
σ and μ phases precipitate in the subgrains and at the subgrain boundaries owing to the two-stage solidification (Lin et al., 2023). The 
differences in the fractions and distributions of precipitate phases caused by the different Mo contents and the coupling effect with 
dislocations lead to different degrees of sharpening of the dislocation cell walls (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that dynamic recrystalli￾zation may occur at the high-temperature tensile conditions of 600 ◦C (>0.35Tm). However, the Mo-rich precipitates that form during 
L-PBF could suppress grain boundary migration via pinning, thereby increasing the size of the recrystallized grains (Wang et al., 2017).
3.6. Ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for revealing the effects of Mo content and temperature
According to Figs. 2, 6, and 7, there are significant differences in the plasticity of HEAs with varying Mo content. To thoroughly 
investigate the reasons behind these differences, we conducted ab initio calculations for auxiliary analysis. As an important 
strengthening and hardening mechanism, the morphology and distribution of the deformation twins are closely related to the Mo 
content and temperature, which directly affect the SFE (Chang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2017). The intrinsic SFE γisf, representing the 
energy barrier of generating intrinsic SFs, determines twin formation. In FCC crystals, we consider the usualaFCC/2 [101](111)FCC slip 
system where a perfect lattice dislocation can dissociate into two Shockley partials with Burgers vectors bFCC
p1 =aFCC/6[112]FCC and 
bFCC
p2 =aFCC/6[211]FCC. aFCC is the FCC lattice parameter. The stacking sequence of (111)FCC close-packed planes is ABC|ABC| ABC …, 
where the labels A through C correspond to the three possible atomic positions in a (111)FCC plane. The schematic diagram is shown in 
Fig. 11a. Next, and intrinsic stacking fault, of energy γiSFE was created by shifting the top ten layers along the [1 1 2] direction by the 
Burgers vector of the Shockley partial bFCC
p1 , this resulted in a stacking sequence: ABC|BC|ABC, shown in Fig. 11b. Our ab initio 
calculation results, depicted in Fig. 11, reveal that γisf is approximately − 21, − 33, and − 48 mJ/m2 for HEAs with 0, 6, and 11 at% Mo, 
respectively, at room temperature. However, at 600 ◦C, γisf is estimated to be approximately − 9, − 15, and − 26 mJ/m2
, respectively. 
Thus, the addition of Mo reduces γisf for the as-built FeCoCrNiMox HEAs, especially at elevated temperatures. As the SFE increases, the 
dynamic recovery becomes more active at high temperatures, facilitating dislocation movement such as cross-slip. However, dynamic 
recovery occurs earlier during deformation at 600 ◦C than at 25 ◦C, leading to a rapid decrease in the work-hardening rate at high 
strain stages. For Mo5 (11 at%), although it has a lower stacking fault energy, we did not observe a significant amount of twinning in 
the matrix. This is because dislocation slip and diffusion mechanisms are more active at high temperatures, which increases the 
activation stress for twinning deformation. Additionally, the presence of a large amount of σ-phase attached to the grain boundaries 
leads to fracture at lower strain values. This reduction in plastic deformation also decreases the occurrence of twinning to some extent. 
The dynamic Hall-Petch effect, induced by the twin boundary in Mo3, introduces new interfaces and reduces the dislocation mean free 
path, providing further contribution. Consequently, the dislocation cell patterns of the FeCoCrNiMox HEAs are altered by the 
Fig. 12. (a) Schematic illustration of the uniaxial tensile MD simulation conducted on a single crystal Mo3 nanowire. (b) Simulated stress-strain 
curves at 25 ◦C and 600 ◦C show difference in elastic modulus and stress softening due to elevated temperature.

13
temperature and Mo content, which is consistent with the experimental observations and TEM characterizations. Because the SFE 
evolution is critical for revealing the potential deformation mechanism in the activation of twinning, ab initio calculations provide 
valuable insight into the design of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs.
In order to further explore the plastic deformation essence of Mo3 alloy, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations. In the MD 
simulations, the Mo3 tensile specimen was simulated using a single-crystal nanowire, as displayed in Fig. 12a. The model had an FCC 
crystal structure with a lattice constant of 3.60 Å. The crystallographic directions along the x, y, and z axes were [001], [110], and 
[110], respectively. The nanowire comprised 100,000 atoms, including 23,254, 23,259, 23,255, 23,256, and 6976 Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, and 
Mo atoms, respectively, thereby satisfying the atomic ratio of FeCoCrNiMo0.3 (Mo3). Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all 
three directions. The top and bottom layers, each measuring 27 Å along the y axis, were fixed. To simulate uniaxial tensile deformation, 
these fixed layers were extended in opposite directions along the y axis, with a stretching speed of 0.02 Å/ps. The deformation zone, 
subjected to stretching, measured 200 × 72 × 64 Å.
As illustrated in Fig. 12b, Mo3 shows significant stress softening at 600 ◦C compared to that at 25 ◦C. Moreover, the elastic modulus 
at 600 ◦C is significantly lower than that at 25 ◦C. As deformation proceeds, twinning occurs, which causes stress drops.
Figs. 13a and 13b illustrate the MD simulations of twin evolution in Mo3 during tensile deformation at room and high tempera￾tures, respectively. The presence of Mo enhances the lattice distortion. During tensile deformation, stacking faults are generated. As the 
strain increases, these stacking faults accumulate, leading to the formation of micro twins (Tian et al., 2024). Despite the generation of 
micro twins at 25 ◦C, the growth of these micro twins is suppressed as the strain continues to increase, because a significant number of 
stacking faults accumulate. This results in an alternating structure of micro twins and stacking faults, thereby enhancing the ductility 
(Guo et al., 2024; He et al., 2021b; Jo et al., 2014 ).
As the temperature rises to 600 ◦C, the SFE gradually increases, as demonstrated by the ab initio calculation results in Fig. 11b. The 
local stress of twinning tends to increase with increasing temperature. Thus, the twin lamellae are larger than those at 25 ◦C, as 
displayed in Fig. 13b. The stacking faults expand during tensile straining, thereby consuming the twins. Consequently, the strength is 
reduced owing to the interaction between stacking faults and twins. Owing to the mutual interaction between the twins and stacking 
faults during tensile deformation, Mo3 still has good ductility at 600 ◦C.
Our calculations at the atomic scale indicate that when HEA yields, the ISF structure emerges within the crystal. Some researchers 
have characterized through TEM that stacking faults and slip are the initial structures observed during the yielding of FCC alloys. With 
increasing temperature, γisf increases, but studies suggest that γui exhibits only slight variations. Temperature provides kinetic energy 
to atomic motion, leading to lower yield strength of materials at elevated temperatures. Tadmor and Bernstein introduced an alter￾native approach known as τa (Bernstein and Tadmor, 2004). The following expression can approximate this method (Wu et al., 2014). 
τa =

1.136 − 0.151 γisf

γesf √
(1) 
Where the γui is the maximum value of intrinsic stacking faults, the γesf is the minimum extrinsic stacking fault. The higher the value 
of τa, the more likely it is to produce extrinsic stacking fault (ESF). As the temperature increases, the proportion of ISF transforming 
into ESF decreases gradually. ISF without transformation to ESF may generate two neighboring ISFs that can be understood as a twin 
(TW) structure. The transformation path of ISF into ESF and then into TW is the sole path of transformation for TW during the 
simulation. The transformation of ISF into TW requires a significant shear stress to take place, and the magnitude of the shear force, 
τTW, can be determined using the following equation (Huang et al., 2006):

According to the Taylor dislocation hardening model, the local shear stress, τTW, increases with an increase in dislocation density 
for FCC metals, which are known for their high-strain hardening ability(Huang et al., 2006).

twinning occurs are 550–600 MPa and 230–245 MPa, respectively. We illustrate the process of twin formation and the necessary range 
of true stress to induce twinning. At room temperature, all alloys exhibit high levels of yield stress, leading to twinning in each case. 
However, at 600 ◦C, Mo0 and Mo1 alloys display lower yield stress levels, while Mo3 and Mo5 exhibit higher levels, consequently 
resulting in twinning in the Mo3 and Mo5 alloys.
3.7. Effect of hierarchical microstructure on mechanical properties
The multiscale strengthening mechanisms of the as-built FeCoCrNiMox HEAs are important for clarifying the deformation mech￾anism, particularly the complex mechanical response of the hierarchical microstructure. For metals, the flow stress (σflow) can be 
expressed as 
σflow = σ0 + σρ + σTW + σIntra
σth
+ σss + σGB + σppt
σath
(4) 
where σath and σth are thermally independent and dependent stress items, respectively, and σ0 is the friction stress from lattice 
resistance (i.e., the Peierls–Nabarro stress), which is 125 MPa for Mo0 (Otto et al., 2013) and 237.19 MPa for Mo1 (Dai et al., 2021) at 
25 ◦C. σ0 can be calculated using the following formula (Ramakrishnan, 1996): 
σ0 = 2MG
1 − ν exp(
− b(1
2π
−
c
ν)
)
(5) 
where c is the distance between adjacent slip surfaces (0.206 nm; a/
√̅̅
3
̅
), M is the Taylor factor (~3.06 for the FCC matrix), α is a 
geometric factor (0.2 for FCC materials), b is the Burgers vector (0.146 nm for Shockley partial dislocations) (Dai et al., 2021), ν is 
Poisson’s ratio, and G is the shear modulus, which is affected by the Mo content (Liu et al., 2020) and temperature (Huang et al., 2015). 
Here, G was calculated and measured experimentally using Young’s modulus. Note that σ0 is temperature-sensitive because it depends 
largely on the short-range atomic order and strength of the atomic bonds. As the temperature increases, the atomic vibrations increase, 
and the atomic bond strength decreases; therefore, σ0 decreases (Wang et al., 2017).
From the ab initio calculations, the SFE of FeCoCrNiMox HEAs decreases with increasing Mo content. Moreover, the stress is below 
the twinning threshold at the initial stage of yielding. Therefore, σTW can be temporarily ignored at the yield deformation stage.
The coarse- and fine-grained regions and dislocation cell patterns inside the L-PBF-processed grains regulate dislocation slip during 
deformation (Liu et al., 2024). Thus, dislocation strengthening and back-stress strengthening in the initial deformation stage are very 
important and collectively increase the hetero-deformation-induced strengthening effect (Chu et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023; Karthik 
and Kim, 2021). For the back stress, which comprises inter- and intragranular stresses, the intergranular stress is nearly zero at the 
initial stage of deformation (An et al., 2023), whereas the intragranular stress, caused by the heterogeneously distributed dislocations 
piling up at the interface (Gao et al., 2022) (i.e., high-density dislocation walls within the cellular structure in Mo0), can be roughly 
estimated by the dislocation hardening model. For Mo1, Mo3, and Mo5, precipitation and solid-solution strengthening suppress 
intragranular stress generation. The empirical relationship for the dislocation hardening stress (σρ) can be expressed as 
σρ = MαGb√̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
ρGND
̅ (6) 
The geometrical factor α is also taken as a constant for FCC martial as 0.2 (Yim et al., 2019). The ρGNDcan be obtained according to 
Table 2. Because dislocation and precipitation strengthening are both related to the cellular structure, the root mean square of the two 
effects, i.e., σcc = √̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅

, can be used to evaluate dislocation-cell strengthening in Mo-containing samples (Liu et al., 2023).

. Here, dp dpis the average radius of the precipitated 
particles and f is the fraction of particles. The characteristics of the precipitates in Mo1, Mo3, and Mo5 were obtained by TEM and in 
our previous work (Lin et al., 2024, 2023). Note that σpptσppt is also affected by temperature, similarly to the variation in shear modulus 
G.
The atomic numbers of Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni are sequentially adjacent; therefore, there is little difference in their atomic radii. 
Consequently, the atomic size mismatch within FCC FeCoCrNi HEAs is negligible. Hence, only Mo is recognized as a strengthening 
element. The solid-solution strengthening stress (σss) caused by Mo is expressed as 
σss = kMocMoσss = kMocMo (8) 
D. Lin et al. International Journal of Plasticity 183 (2024) 104142

where cMo is the concentration of solute Mo atoms and kMo is the strengthening coefficient of the matrix (19.4 MPa/at%) (Kenji et al., 
2002).

where kHP is the Hall–Petch coefficient (taken as 226 MPa/μm1/2 from the FeCoCrNiMn system) (Peng et al., 2022). Although there is 
no obvious difference in grain size between the samples with different Mo contents, kHP is influenced by both interstitial and sub￾stitutional elements. This leads to a correction term of 48[Mo] (where [Mo] is the Mo concentration in at%) (Kenji et al., 2002) for kHP 
in the Fe–Cr–Ni system, which is quite near the measured kHP value of 297 MPa/μm1/2 for Mo1 (Dai et al., 2021). Therefore, σGB is

Figs. 14a and 14b compare the sum and contribution of each stress strengthening term to the yield strength during tensile 
deformation at room and high temperatures, respectively, which show good agreement with the experimental results. The most 
significant contribution is dislocation cell-coupled strengthening, which is characteristic of L-PBF-processed metals. Compared with 
Mo0, an appropriate Mo addition (≥7 at%) can markedly enhance the yield strength of FeCoCrNi-based HEAs, especially at high 
temperatures. This is because, although high temperatures can induce grain recovery, the solid-solution and precipitation strength￾ening induced by Mo can impede dislocation slip and exert a grain-boundary pinning effect.
However, the TEM characterization, ab initio calculations, and MD simulations reveal that excess Mo (e.g., 11.11 at%, Mo5) leads to 
excessive precipitation at grain boundaries. This significantly increases the SFE at high temperatures and hinders continuous dislo￾cation slip after the initiation of yielding, culminating in a substantial decrease in the uniform elongation of samples with high Mo 
contents. Although the SFE of samples with low or no Mo (~2.4 at%, Mo1; 0 at%, Mo0) increases less than that of Mo5 at high 
temperatures, the fracture of these samples occurs before the tensile stress reaches the critical value for twinning, resulting in a sig￾nificant loss of strength and toughness and compromising their high-temperature performance. Moreover, the critical twinning stress 
decreases within coarse grains (Cai et al., 2017; Wagner and Laplanche, 2023); therefore, the larger grain size of Mo3 is conducive to 
twinning. The dynamic Hall–Petch effect further enhances the strain-hardening ability (Liu et al., 2022). Consequently, an optimal Mo 
content (~7 at%, Mo3) can maintain the effects of solid-solution and precipitation strengthening while also inducing twinning in the 
later stages of deformation, which further enhances the dislocation hardening ability.
Fig. 14c depicts the distinctive mechanical performance of the L-PBF-processed FeCoCrNiMox HEAs versus other alloys at 600 ◦C 
(see Fig. 2d and the Supplementary Material for further detail). By incorporating an optimal amount of Mo (7–11 at%), it is possible to 
regulate multiple strengthening and hardening mechanisms. These mechanisms include solid-solution strengthening, grain-boundary 
strengthening, precipitation strengthening, and twinning. This regulation facilitates enhanced strength–ductility synergy in Mo3 at 
elevated temperatures.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we systematically studied the mechanical properties of L-PBF additively manufactured FeCoCrNiMox HEAs with 
varying Mo contents at both room and elevated temperatures (25 and 600 ◦C, respectively). A multiscale analysis, incorporating SEM, 
EBSD, TEM, and quantitative simulations, was conducted to assess the microstructural evolution and tensile deformation and elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms. The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows:
1. The L-PBF-processed FeCoCrNiMox specimens exhibit a near-defect-free matrix with distinct dislocation cell patterns. With the 
addition of Mo (2.44, 6.98, and 11.11 at%), σ-phase precipitation increases, accompanied by sharpening of the dislocation cell 
walls.
2. In conjunction with ab initio calculations, MD simulations, and TEM observations, the SFE of the FeCoCrNiMox HEAs decreases with 
increasing Mo content and increases at elevated temperatures. As a result, twinning is more likely to occur at room temperature for 
all samples. However, at 600 ◦C, twinning is only observed for Mo3 owing to the increased SFE.
3. The addition of Mo to the FeCoCrNi matrix promotes both solid-solution and precipitation strengthening. By leveraging the 
versatility and rapid cooling of L-PBF, the introduction of an appropriate amount of Mo (7–11 at%) allows for precise micro￾structural control. This results in the simultaneous or sequential regulation of multiple strengthening mechanisms, including 
dislocation hardening, solid-solution strengthening, precipitation strengthening, hetero-deformation-induced strengthening, and 
twinning. Consequently, FeCoCrNiMox HEAs (x = 0.3–0.5) exhibit improved formability at room temperature and enhanced 
strength–ductility synergy at high temperatures. Specifically, the YS, UTS, and uniform elongation reach 580 MPa, 800 MPa, and 
20%, respectively.
This study successfully demonstrates the relationship between the processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of FCC 
FeCoCrNiMox HEAs at both room and elevated temperatures. Multiscale investigations, encompassing both experimental observations 
and modeling simulations, promote the understanding of the deformation mechanisms in Mo-doped HEAs. This understanding is based

16
on key microstructural characteristics such as stacking faults, twins, precipitates, and dislocation cell patterns, verifying the feasibility 
of using L-PBF to regulate the sequential activation of different strengthening mechanisms. Conventional methods such as SEM, TEM, 
and EBSD cannot capture the microstructure and twinning process at high temperatures. However, we have revealed this process 
through first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. By combining experimental observations with simulations, 
we have thoroughly analyzed the plastic deformation mechanisms of HEA alloys. This approach provides valuable insights for the 
development of new materials. This study provides valuable insights for structural HEAs to achieve synergistic high-temperature 
mechanical properties, thereby proving their significance and practicality in both scientific and engineering contexts.
