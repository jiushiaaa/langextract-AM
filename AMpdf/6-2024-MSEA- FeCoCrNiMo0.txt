ABSTRACT 
FeCoCrNi, a high-entropy alloy fabricated by laser powder bed fusion, has excellent room-temperature me￾chanical properties but poor high-temperature mechanical performance. To expand the application of FeCoCrNi, 
in this study, we added Mo to form σ precipitates, which improved the high-temperature mechanical properties 
of the alloy via Orowan strengthening. We also elucidated the main deformation mechanism of FeCoCrNiMo0.5, 
involving the transformation of the deformational mode from dislocation-based motion to twinning deformation. 
1. Introduction 
Metallic materials exhibit increased plasticity and decreased strength 
at elevated temperatures because dislocation motion and grain bound￾ary (GB) slip are facilitated by the augmented atomic diffusion and 
weakened atomic bonding of metal species at higher temperatures 
[1–4]. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), originally defined as consisting of 
five elements with equal or nearly equal atomic proportions [5–7], have 
been extensively investigated as high-performance materials with high 
strength, high hardness, and high-temperature oxidation resistance 
[8–13]. With the improved understanding of HEAs, it has been noted 
that the above definition cannot accurately account for all the charac￾teristics of HEAs, and the precise definition of HEAs is being reconsid￾ered. Among the different HEAs, FeCoCrNi HEAs have been the most 
widely studied candidates. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with the 
characteristics of direct forming is an advanced manufacturing tech￾nology for fabricating structural materials with high precision in a short 
time [14–16]. The LPBF method for preparing FeCoCrNi HEA compo￾nents overcomes the difficulty associated with the deformation of 
high-strength alloys [17]. In addition, LPBF-FeCoCrNi HEAs exhibit 
better room-temperature mechanical performance than the HEAs 
prepared using conventional methods [18–21]. However, they still show 
a softening phenomenon at high operational temperature [21]. There￾fore, it is imperative to improve the high-temperature strengths of 
LPBF-FeCoCrNi HEAs. 
The performance of FeCoCrNi HEAs is typically improved by 
compositional modification with the addition of other elements, such as 
Al [22,23], Si [24], Mo [25–29], Mn [30], Nb [31,32], and W [33]. 
Although the addition of certain elements, such as Al, Si, Mn, and Nb, 
significantly changes the room-temperature strength of FeCoCrNi HEAs, 
high-temperature softening is also clearly noticed. In certain cases, a 
significant reduction in their high-temperature plasticity is observed. 
The addition of Mo has unique effects on FeCoCrNi HEAs, because it 
induces the formation of a hard intermetallic σ phase [25–28], which 
promotes the solid-solution and precipitation strengthening phenom￾ena, thereby significantly increasing both the yield and tensile strengths 
of the HEA. In addition, compared with other alloys, FeCoCrNiMo HEAs 
exhibit improved elongation and ductility. Peng et al. [26] successfully 
synthesized completely dense FeCoCrNiMo HEAs using two processes, 
viz., spark plasma sintering and vacuum hot-press sintering, and re￾ported that FeCoCrNiMo HEAs have excellent hardness and wear resis￾tance but poor strength and plasticity owing to the precipitation of hard

and brittle phases, including the σ phase and carbides like Mo2C and 
Cr23C6. Further, Cai et al. [27] fabricated an FeCoCrNiMo0.23 HEA using 
a powder metallurgical method and demonstrated its good ductility 
(elongation = 51%) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS = 784 MPa) 
owing to nano-twin and microband generation during its tensile defor￾mation. Chen et al. [28] synthesized an FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA by LPBF 
and demonstrated its improved strength (UTS = 1110 MPa) and good 
plasticity (elongation = 30.1%) owing to the formation of a few nano￾particle precipitates. Thus, FeCoCrNiMo HEAs synthesized by LPBF 
exhibit excellent room-temperature performance. However, there has 
been little research on the high-temperature mechanical performance of 
LPBF-FeCoCrNiMo HEAs. 
In this study, we designed and fabricated an FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA 
(Mo content of 11.12 at%) by LPBF and evaluated its high-temperature 
mechanical properties. The study findings indicate that the FeCoCr￾NiMo0.5 HEA has better high-temperature mechanical properties than 
the existing HEAs and other common high-temperature alloys. The ef￾fect of the alloy microstructure on the high-temperature performance 
and deformation mechanism of the FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA were also 
investigated. 
2. Materials and methods 
FeCoCrNi and FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA powders with spherical particles 
of a nominal size (15–53 μm) were synthesized via a gas-atomization 
process. The samples were formed on a RENISHAW AM-400 LPBF 
platform (Fig. 1(c)) using the following process parameters: substrate

80 μm, point spacing = 60 μm, exposure time = 80 μs, wavelength =
1070 nm, layer thickness = 40 μm, and interlayer rotation angle = 67◦
(Fig. 1(d)). Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) images of the two HEA powders produced using these parameters. 
Tensile testing was conducted on a 3910-type microcomputer-controlled 
electronic universal testing machine in the temperature range of 
600–900 ◦C, and the high-temperature tensile strain rate was 8.33 ×
10− 5 s
− 1
. SEM coupled with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was 
conducted to characterize the morphologies of the pristine and mixed 
powders, as well as the as-printed samples and the samples subjected to 
tensile testing. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) was 
performed to analyze the chemical compositions of the samples. Bright￾field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) was conducted to 
characterize the crystal structures and dislocation morphologies of the 
matrix phase and secondary phases. 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 1(f1) and (g1) show the inverse pole figures of the as-printed 
FeCoCrNi and FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA samples (hereafter referred to as 
Mo-0 and Mo-5, respectively) along the X-Z plane. The microstructures 
of the two samples generally exhibit columnar grains and a tendency for

vertical growth, but the grains in Mo-5 are clearly refined. In the BF￾TEM image of the Mo-0 MEA (Fig. 1(f2)), no precipitate phase is 
observed at the dislocation network position, and the SAED pattern in 
Fig. 1(f3) reveals that the microstructure of Mo-0 in the dislocation 
network position has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. In contrast, 
Mo-5 exhibits a net-like precipitate phase at the dislocation network 
positions, and the selected position corresponds to the σ phase (Fig. 1 
(g2, g3)). According to the SAED pattern of Mo-5, the hard intermetallic 
phase is the σ phase with a tetragonal structure, and the matrix retained 
its FCC structure. 
Fig. 2(a) shows the tensile stress–strain curves of the printed Mo- 
0 and Mo-5 samples, recorded at the temperatures of 600, 700, and 
800 ◦C. A significant difference is observed in the high-temperature 
tensile performances of Mo-5 and Mo-0. The strengths of both Mo-5 
and Mo-0 decreased significantly with increasing temperature; howev￾er, their yield and tensile strengths at the same temperature differed 
significantly. Compared with the yield strength and UTS values of Mo-0, 
those of Mo-5 increased by 46.3 and 90.1%, respectively, at 600 ◦C, by 
85.5 and 102.1%, respectively, at 700 ◦C, and by 52.9 and 146.6%, 
respectively, at 800 ◦C. The plasticities of Mo-0 and Mo-5 exhibited an 
increasing trend with increasing temperature, but a decrease in plas￾ticity was observed at 700 ◦C for both samples. Specifically, both 
samples showed a significant decrease in plasticity between 600 and 
700 ◦C; however, the plasticity increased significantly at 800 ◦C (elon￾gation = 14.1%), particularly for Mo-5. Fig. 2(b) compares the UTS and 
elongation of Mo-5 at elevated temperatures with those of commonly 
used high-temperature alloys and HEAs [34–40]. The Mo-5 sample 
synthesized by the LPBF process in this study has excellent overall 
performance in all temperature ranges, and it exhibits higher strength 
and greater ductility than the other samples. 
To further explore the deformation mechanism of Mo-5 at high 
temperatures, the microstructures of Mo-0 and Mo-5 were compared 
after they were subjected to high-temperature tensile testing at the 
strain rate of 8.33 × 10− 5 s
− 1
. Fig. 3 shows the fracture surface mor￾phologies of Mo-0 and Mo-5 after tensile testing at different tempera￾tures. Cracks and pores were evident on the fracture surface of Mo-5 
subjected to tensile testing at 800 ◦C (Fig. 3(f)), but not on those sub￾jected to tensile deformation at 600 ◦C and 700 ◦C. In contrast, the 
fracture surface of Mo-0 exhibited distinct cracks and pores after high￾temperature tensile testing at 600 ◦C (Fig. 3(a–c)), clearly indicating 
that the addition of Mo can effectively improve the GB strength and 
reduce the susceptibility of the FeCoCrNi HEA to crack. Mazanov ´ a ´ et al. 
[41] reported that cracks are more likely to develop at high-angle grain 
boundaries (GBs). A comparison of the GB angles at the cracks in Mo-0

and Mo-5 (Fig. 4(a1–c5)) subjected to tensile testing at different high 
temperatures confirmed that cracks occurred at high-angle GBs. To 
investigate the relationship between the GB angles and crack formation, 
140 cracks in the LPBF specimens were statistically analyzed by EBSD. 
Fig. 4(d) shows the overall GB angle distribution of Mo-0 and Mo-5 after 
tensile testing at different temperatures. The low-angle GBs accounted 
for a large fraction of cracks owing to the occurrence of numerous dis￾locations in the microstructure during tensile deformation. However, 
statistics related to the GB angle at the crack initiation location (Fig. 4 
(e)) indicated that the high-angle GBs accounted for 80.7% of the total 
number of cracks, with the average GB being 33.0276◦. This result 
suggests that the tensile fracture characteristics of the Mo-0 and Mo-5 
HEAs correlate with their GB angles. 
Ming et al. [42] reported that GB nanoclusters represent the main 
cause of high-temperature plasticity loss in FCC-structured HEAs. This is 
because of the enrichment of the elements at the GBs during the 
high-temperature tensile process, resulting in a weakened GB interface 
and micropore formation. Dense micropore defects are then connected 
to form crack sources. A similar phenomenon was observed in the cases 
of Mo-0 and Mo-5, in which cracks were generated at the GBs. Fig. 5(a) 
shows that Fe, Co, Cr, and Ni formed distinct nanoclusters at the GBs of 
Mo-0. Further, Fig. 5(b) shows the BF-TEM microstructure and EDS data 
of the GB of Mo-5 after high-temperature tensile deformation at 800 ◦C. 
Notably, it is impossible to accurately determine whether the elements 
at the GB retain their nanocluster structures after Mo addition because of 
the formation of the σ phase at the GB. A comparison of the 
high-temperature plasticities of Mo-0 and Mo-5 at different tempera￾tures revealed that, overall, the high-temperature plasticity of Mo-5 
increased with increasing Mo content. Determining whether the nano￾clusters remained at the GBs is difficult. However, with the addition of 
Mo, the σ phase was diffusely cross-distributed at the GBs, as shown in 
Fig. 5(c). The distribution of the σ phase strengthened the GBs and 
prevented crack extension during deformation. The effects of the σ phase 
and twin deformation mechanism (described later) effectively mitigated 
the plasticity degradation caused by nanoclusters at 700 ◦C. 
According to the uniform tensile deformation microstructure 
presented in Fig. 6, the number of dislocation networks and entangle￾ments in Mo-0 and Mo-5 decreased during high-temperature tensile 
testing, and a twinning structure was formed in Mo-5. As a slip source, 
twins guide dislocation slip, effectively reducing lattice distortion in 
grains and promoting the plastic deformation of the material. This also 
contributed significantly to the improved plasticity of Mo-5. When the 
test temperature reached 700 ◦C, the substructure became sparse, a 
portion of the secondary phase was transformed into a granular one, and 
the number of twins was increased (Fig. 6(d)). However, twins cannot 
pass through the σ phase during movement, and the tetragonal σ phase 
cannot synergistically deform with the FCC-structured matrix. These 
inabilities result in stress concentration at the grain interfaces. By 
contrast, at 800 ◦C (Fig. 6(e)), the resistance to atomic migration 
decreased, leading to reduced resistance between the σ phase and ma￾trix, which facilitated the deformation of the HEA. In addition, the 
complete transformation of the σ phase from a strip-like form to a 
granular one and the reduced number of twins led to minimized dislo￾cation hindrance and local stress concentration, which increased the 
high-temperature plasticity of the HEA. At the same time, due to the 
accumulation of deformation energy at 800 ◦C, dynamic recrystalliza￾tion occurred in the system, which further improved the plasticity of the 
alloy at this temperature. 
For Mo-5, i.e., the FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA, the strip-shaped σ phase was 
observed at 600 ◦C (Fig. 6(c)), and numerous dislocations were found to 
accumulate at the interface between the σ phase and matrix, indicating 
that the strip-shaped σ phase significantly hindered the movement of 
dislocations. Further observations revealed that the dislocations did not 
pass through the σ phase, suggesting that the σ phase is responsible for 
Orowan strengthening. Moreover, lamellar structures, identified as 
twins, were observed in the deformed microstructure of Mo-5. Accord￾ing to previous studies [43–45], the deformation mechanisms of 
FCC-structured alloys are closely related to their stacking fault energy 
(SFE). The SFE determines how difficult it is for stacking faults and twins 
to form. With increasing SFE, the deformation mechanism transforms 
from dislocation slip (SFE ≥40 mJ/m2
) to dislocation slip combined 
with deformation twin (20 mJ/m2 ≤ SFE ≤40 mJ/m2
) and dislocation

slip combined with phase transformation (SFE ≤20 mJ/m2
) [45]. Zad￾dach [43] calculated the SFE of an FeCoCrNiMn HEA by combining 
experimental and theoretical data, while Gao et al. [45] calculated the 
SFE of an FeCoCrNiMox HEA using X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. In this 
study, we similarly calculated the SFE values of Mo-0 and Mo-5 using

where K111ω0 is the proportional constant (=6.6), and G(111) is the shear 
modulus of the (111) plane (the macro-shear moduli of Mo-0 and Mo-5

software). Further, α0 is the lattice constant determined by XRD (Fig. 2

The SFE values of Mo-0 and Mo-5 were calculated to be 32.5 and 
17.9, respectively. At the same time, the comparison of the micro￾structures revealed that as the deformation temperature was increased 
continuously, the dislocation network essentially disappeared at 700 ◦C, 
and no dislocation structure was observed at 800 ◦C. Further, the 
number of twins increased significantly, confirming that the deforma￾tion mechanism of the FeCoCrNi HEA was changed from dislocation￾motion-dominant to twinning-dominant deformation after the addition 
of Mo. Literature survey on similar changes in the deformation mecha￾nisms of alloys revealed that the size and number of twins observed in 
the HEAs examined in this study were similar to those observed in other 
studies [46–48]. Thus, the LPBF-FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA exhibited 
improved strength and plasticity. In addition, owing to the character￾istics of rapid solidification under the LPBF process, the σ phase served 
as the crystal nuclei, increasing the nucleation rate of the HEA grains. 
Furthermore, crystal growth was limited because of the rapid solidifi￾cation speed of the alloy, and thus abundant nuclei were formed. This 
contributed to the aforementioned grain refinement of Mo-5. The 
solid-solution strengthening effect derived from Mo, the Orowan 
strengthening effect and grain refinement derived from the precipitation 
of the σ phase, and the twinning-induced strengthening effect derived

from the reduction in the SFE are the main reasons for the improved 
strength of Mo-5. 
Fig. 6(f) illustrates the high-temperature deformation mechanisms of 
the Mo-0 and Mo-5 HEAs. As the HEA was heated, the alloy micro￾structure changed significantly at 800 ◦C, the dislocation network 
structure disappeared, and the density of the σ phase increased sub￾stantially. The strip-shaped σ phase nearly disappeared, and numerous 
granular σ phases precipitated. Further, the number of twins decreased, 
and the twins appeared to have passed through the σ phase. However, 
because the σ phase and twins have different crystal structures, twins 
cannot pass through the σ phase. Thus, we infer that the granular σ 
phase was formed after twin formation. The inhibitory effect of the 
granular σ phase on dislocation was clearly reduced, which in turn 
decreased the high-temperature strength of the HEA. In summary, the 
morphological transformation of the σ phase from a strip-like form to a 
granular one, decreased dislocation entanglement, and the reduced 
number of twins led to decreased high-temperature strength of Mo-5. 
However, Mo-5 still had a significantly greater high-temperature 
strength than Mo-0 because of the presence of secondary phases and 
twinning microstructures in its matrix. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, FeCoCrNi and FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEAs were synthesized 
by LPBF, and their high-temperature mechanical performances were 
evaluated. The strengthening mechanisms of the two HEAs (with and 
without Mo) were also investigated. The LPBF-FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA was 
found to have a lower SFE than the LPBF-FeCoCrNi HEA, and twins were 
observed in the deformed microstructure of the former. Cracking usually 
occurred at high-angle GBs, and the dominant deformation mechanism 
changed from dislocation motion to twinning after the addition of Mo to 
FeCoCrNi. The precipitation of the σ phase resulted in high strength and 
ductility of the LPBF-FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA at elevated temperatures. In 
particular, at 800 ◦C, the FeCoCrNiMo0.5 HEA exhibited a 146.6% in￾crease in high-temperature strength and 137.6% increase in elongation 
compared with those of the LPBF-FeCoCrNi HEA sample without Mo.
